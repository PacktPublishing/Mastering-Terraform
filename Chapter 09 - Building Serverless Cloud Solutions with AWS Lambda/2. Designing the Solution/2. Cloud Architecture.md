# Cloud Architecture

In Chapter 7, our cloud-hosting solution was a set of dedicated EC2 instances, and in Chapter 9, it was a set of shared EC2 instances managed by our Kubernetes cluster’s node pool. Using virtual machines, whether standalone VMs or part of a Kubernetes node pool, has the most sunk cost. 

In Chapter 8, our entire solution was executed on containers that allowed the front and back end to coexist as a set of containers on the same Virtual Machines. This saved some money, but we still needed servers to host the workload. In this chapter, we have a new objective: take advantage of the power of the cloud by leveraging cloud-native services that abstract the underlying infrastructure from us and allow us to truly pay for only what we use. AWS’s serverless offerings will be crucial to us in this endeavor.

## Frontend
In previous chapters, we hosted our front end on public-facing servers that returned the HTML and JavaScript that composed our web application. However, we still require a cloud-hosted solution to host the files and respond to requests in both solutions. 

However, due to the nature of the web application running within the end user’s browser, we don’t need to use cloud-hosted Virtual Machines to host what are essentially flat files. We can use simple cloud storage to host the front end as a static website and rely on the cloud platform to shoulder the burden of returning the web content. 

On AWS, we can use the Simple Storage Service—or S3. This service allows us to host static web content that is internet accessible, and S3 handles all the load balancing, SSL termination, and scaling up to meet huge spikes in demand.

_S3 handles web page requests, Lambda handles REST API requests_ 

In order to do this, we'll need an S3 bucket and enable public internet access to its contents. This will require a combination of S3 and IAM configuration. All S3 buckets have an internet-accessible public domain. When we activate the static websites feature of S3, internet traffic gets routed to content hosted in our bucket.

This will give us a huge advantage because S3 has no sunk costs. Creating an S3 bucket costs you absolutely zero dollars ($0) per month. Like other serverless offerings, it uses a set of micro-transactions to measure your activity and charge you for precisely what you use. In S3, this can be a bit complicated as several measurements incur costs.

| Metric             | Unit         | Scale  | Price   |
| ------------------ | ------------ | ------ | ------- |
| Storage            | GBs          | 1,000  | $0.023  |
| Read Transactions  | Transactions | 10,000 | $0.0004 |
| Write Transactions | Transactions | 10,000 | $0.005  |
| Other Operations   | Transactions | 10,000 | $0.01   |

The table above shows all the costs you will run into when using AWS to host your static websites. The prices listed are for AWS’s West US 2 region (Oregon) at the time of writing. Prices may have changed by the time you read this, so it’s best to check the latest prices for the most accurate cost estimation. 

I included these prices to make a point. We can host a static website on a three-node Kubernetes cluster for approximately $300 a month or on AWS S3 for less than $0.01 a month. Which approach would you choose?

## Backend
Like our Frontend, in previous chapters, our Backend was also hosted on Virtual Machines in two different ways: dedicated Virtual Machines and shared Virtual Machines within the node pool on our Kubernetes cluster.

Unlike the front end, our back end doesn't have the option of running entirely client-side inside the end user's web browser. In the Backend, we have custom code that needs to run on a server. Therefore, we need to find a solution to host these components without all the overhead of a fleet of Virtual Machines.

We can use Lambda Functions on AWS to accomplish this. AWS Lambda is a managed service that allows you to deploy your code without paying the sunk costs for any of the underlying Virtual Machines. Like S3, it has its micro-transactional pricing model that charges you for precisely what you use.

| Metric           | Unit         | Scale     | Price ($)     |
| ---------------- | ------------ | --------- | ------------- |
| Execution Time   | GB/s         | 1         | $0.0000166667 |
| Total Executions | Transactions | 1,000,000 | $0.020        |

The above table shows the costs associated with deploying your code to Lambda Functions. The first thing you’ll probably notice is that, like S3, these prices are extremely low but measure a very small amount of activity on the platform. 

For example, the Execution Time metric has a unit of `GB/s`, which is the amount of memory your Lambda Function uses per second in Gigabytes. Given that it measures at a 'per second' interval, you don't have to run your Lambda Functions very long to rack up quite a few of these. The execution time cost can be adjusted based on how much memory you allocate—any memory between 128 MBs and 10 GBs.

While straightforward, the total executions metric is subject to AWS Lambda's built-in constraints, including execution time limits. For example, each of these executions is limited to fifteen (15) minutes. Suppose you are trying to respond to requests from a web application. In that case, you probably won’t want to design your Lambda Function to take fifteen (15) minutes anyway, as this would be a poor experience for the end user using the Web Browser. In this scenario, you want your Lambda Function to return in no more than a few seconds. However, Lambda Functions can be employed for many different tasks besides responding to HTTP requests from a browser. In these situations, you must carefully design your Lambda solution to stay within this execution time limitation. This may require you to think about how to split up the work so that it can be processed more parallelly by hundreds, if not thousands, of instances of your Lambda Function.

_Backend's architecture using Lambda_


Previously, our ASP.NET REST API was set up using a traditional ASP.NET project that used Controllers to implement the REST API endpoints. However, when transitioning to Lambda Functions, we expect the codebase to be structured much differently. To host our REST API as Lambda Functions, we need to conform to the framework that Lambda dictates. As a result, the ASP.NET controller classes must be refactored to conform to this standard. In the next section, we’ll delve into the code that makes this possible.
