# Deployment Architecture

Now that we have a good idea of what our Cloud Architecture for our solution on AWS will look like, we need to devise a plan for provisioning our environments and deploying our code.

In Chapter 7, when we deployed our application to Virtual Machines, we baked our compiled Application Code into a Virtual Machine image using Packer. Similarly, in Chapter 8, when we deployed our application to containers on our Kubernetes cluster, we baked our Application Code into container images using Docker. With serverless, this completely changes because AWSâ€™s serverless offerings completely abstract away the Operating System. This means that all we are responsible for is producing a compatible deployment package.

## Creating the Deployment Package

As we discussed in the previous section, we have two components of our application: the front end and the back end. Each has a different deployment target. For the front end, we are going to be deploying as a static website to AWS S3, while the back end is going to be deployed as an AWS Lambda Function. Since both are .NET projects, we will be using both .NET and AWS platform-specific tools in order to create deployment packages and deploy them to their target AWS services. The diagram below shows the process we go through in order to provision our environment, package our application code, and deploy it to the target environment out in AWS.

For the front end, this means enabling the feature to deploy our ASP.NET Blazor web application as a Web Assembly. This will allow the front end to be hosted as a static website running completely client-side without server-side rendering. This is only possible because of the way we have designed our front-end web application, which uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to interact with server-side REST APIs. It's important to note that ASP.NET Blazor supports both hosting options. Still, we chose to go down the client-side-only path and eliminate any dependency on server-side page rendering. As a result, when we use the .NET CLI to publish our ASP.NET Blazor project, it will emit a folder containing static web content. Then, using the AWS CLI, we can upload the contents of this folder to our S3 Bucket to complete the deployment.

Using the .NET CLI, we publish our project for the Backend, which emits all the files necessary for the AWS Lambda service to recognize and execute our Lambda Function.

For the Backend, again using the .NET CLI, we need to publish our project. This will emit all the files needed to inform the Lambda Functions service about our little Lambda Function. Once this is done, we must zip this folder into a zip archive. Finally, we can use the AWS CLI to deploy this zip archive to our Lambda Function.
