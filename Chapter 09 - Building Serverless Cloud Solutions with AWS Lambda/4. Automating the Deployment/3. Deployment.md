# Deployment

Now that Terraform has provisioned the AWS infrastructure that we need for our serverless solution, we need to take the final step of deploying both the deployment artifacts to the appropriate locations in AWS.

_The .NET CLI produces deployment artifacts that are provisioned to AWS after Terraform executes_

We will use .NET and AWS custom tools to produce and deploy the artifacts to these target locations.

## Frontend

As we saw in other chapters, our .NET application code needs to follow a Continuous Integration process where the code is built and tested using automated unit testing and other built-in quality controls. Nothing changes there, except that we need to add some special handling to the deployment artifact that these processes produce in order to make sure it is available to our GitHub Action's job that deploys the workload to the appropriate location.

The `dotnet publish` command outputs the deployment artifact of the .NET application code. This output for the ASP.NET Blazor web application is a folder container, a collection of loose files with HTML, JavaScript, and CSS in it. In order to pass all these files efficiently from one GitHub Actions Job to another, we need to zip them up into a single file.

	    - name: Generate the Deployment Package
	      run: |
	        zip -r ../deployment.zip ./
	      working-directory: ${{ env.DOTNET_WORKING_DIRECTORY }}/publish

Now that the static web content is zipped into a zip archive, we use the `upload-artifact` GitHub Action to save this file to GitHub Actions. This will make the file available for future jobs that are executed within the pipeline.

	    - name: Upload Deployment Package
	      uses: actions/upload-artifact@v2
	      with:
	        name: dotnet-deployment
	        path: ${{ env.DOTNET_WORKING_DIRECTORY }}/deployment.zip

Future jobs can simply download the artifact using a corresponding `download-artifact` GitHub Action and the same name that was used to upload it.

	    - uses: actions/download-artifact@v3
	      with:
	        name: dotnet-deployment

Because the ASP.NET Blazor web application will be hosted as static web content on our AWS S3 bucket, we need to ensure that we unzip it before uploading the contents. If we were to upload the zip archive to S3, the web application wouldn't work correctly because all the web content would be trapped inside the archive file.

	    - name: Unzip Deployment Package
	      run: |
	        mkdir -p ${{ env.DOTNET_WORKING_DIRECTORY }}/upload-staging
	        unzip ./deployment.zip -d ${{ env.DOTNET_WORKING_DIRECTORY }}/upload-staging

Now that the static web content is unzipped to the staging directory, we can use the `aws s3 syncÂ ` command to deploy all of the files in the folder to the S3 bucket.

	      - id: deploy
	        name: Upload to S3 Bucket
	        env:
	          AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: ${{ vars.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}
	          AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}
	          AWS_REGION: ${{ vars.BACKEND_REGION }}
	        working-directory: ${{ env.DOTNET_WORKING_DIRECTORY }}/upload-staging
	        run: |
	          aws s3 sync . s3://${{ needs.terraform.outputs.frontend_bucket_name }}


## Backend

To deploy the Lambda Function, the exact same process is followed to pass the artifact from the GitHub Actions job that builds the deployment artifact to the job that actually deploys it. 

The only difference is that we use the `aws lambda update-function-code` command to provision a zip archive to the Lambda Function.

	      - name: Deploy
	        env:
	          AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: ${{ vars.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}
	          AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}
	          AWS_REGION: ${{ vars.BACKEND_REGION }}
	          FUNCTION_NAME: ${{needs.terraform.outputs.lambda_function_name}}
	        run: |
	          aws lambda update-function-code --function-name $FUNCTION_NAME --zip-file fileb://deployment.zip

Unlike how we provisioned the front end, we don't need to unzip the deployment package for the Lambda Function. AWS Lambda expects our application code to be bundled into a zip archive.

That's it! Now, our application has been fully deployed to AWS S3 and Lambda!
