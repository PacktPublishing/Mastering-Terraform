# Terraform

The first thing that we need to do is to provision our environment to AWS. This is going to be extremely similar to the way we did this in the previous chapters. In Chapter 7, we needed to ensure that our Virtual Machine images were built and available before we executed Terraform because the Terraform codebase referenced the Virtual Machine images when it provisioned the Virtual Machines.  With our Virtual Machine architecture, application deployment happens before Terraform provisions the environment.

_Packer-produced Virtual Machine images are a pre-requisite for Terraform_

In Chapter 8, we provisioned our Kubernetes cluster using AWS Elastic Kubernetes Service without such a pre-requisite. In fact, the application deployment occurred after the Kubernetes cluster was online. This means that with Container-based architecture, application deployment happens after Terraform provisions the environment.

_Docker produced Container images are provisioned to Kubernetes after Terraform executes_

When using AWS’s serverless offerings, the deployment process mirrors that of what we saw when deploying our application as containers to Kubernetes. Just like with this approach, we need to build a deployment artifact for AWS’s serverless offerings. For the front end, that means simply generating the static web content, and for the back end, that means generating a Lambda Functions zip archive. These artifacts share a similar purpose to the Docker images in that they are a target service-compatible way of packaging our application for deployment.

_The .NET CLI produces deployment artifacts that are provisioned to AWS after Terraform executes_

As you can see the serverless deployment looks very similar to the approach used with the container-based architecture. That’s because AWS is fulfilling the role that Kubernetes played when using a serverless approach. AWS just has custom tools to facilitate the deployment of the application.
