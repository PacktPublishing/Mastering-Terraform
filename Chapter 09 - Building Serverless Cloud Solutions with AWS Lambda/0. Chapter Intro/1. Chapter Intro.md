# 1. Chapter Intro

In this chapter, we turn the page to the final installment of our three-part series on Amazon Web Services. Having previously built solutions on AWS using Virtual Machines in Chapter 7 and then in containers in Chapter 8, our journey now leads us to explore what building a truly Serverless solution looks like on AWS.

While the foundational concepts and practices from the preceding chapters will help us, some aspects of the solution are completely absent. Namely, we don’t need to worry about any Operating System configuration, whether it be in Packer or Docker. 

Our attention now turns to adapting our Application Code to Lambda’s application model. While this necessitates changes to our application code to align with Lambda’s approach, it presents opportunities to enhance scalability and efficiency without the burden of managing servers. This shift in focus promises a more streamlined and efficient process, where we’ll spend a bit more time adjusting our application code to conform than provisioning new services using Terraform.
