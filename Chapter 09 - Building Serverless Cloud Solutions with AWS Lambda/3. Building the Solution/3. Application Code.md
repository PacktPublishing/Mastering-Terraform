# Application Code

AWS Lambda is inherently event-based. Each Lambda Function is triggered by a different type of event, and the AWS Lambda service provides many different event types to trigger your Lambda Function from a wide variety of other AWS Services. This makes it easy to design Lambda Functions that can respond to all sorts of activities within your AWS environment. For the purposes of this book, we’ll focus on the Application Load Balancer only, but if you are interested, I’d recommend you check out all the other options that AWS Lambda has—they are quite extensive.

_ASP.NET MVC Controller Class Anatomy_

In a traditional ASP.NET REST API solution, you have Controller Classes embodying a specific route and methods that implement different operations at that route. The Controller Class must be decorated with an `ApiController` attribute informing the ASP.NET runtime that this class should be used to process incoming web requests at the route specified in the `Route` attribute.

Each method is decorated with an attribute that denotes which HTTP Verb the method should respond to. In the above example, we use `HttpGet`, but there are corresponding attributes for each supported HTTP Verbs. The method can take strongly typed parameters that can be part of the route, the Query String, or the request body. The method returns an `IActionResult` by default, which allows us to return different data structures depending on the outcome of the request.

To implement a REST API using Lambda Functions, we need to implement a class using the Lambda Function SDK. This requires us to slightly adjust how we implement both our class and our method. We will employ different class and method attributes to achieve a similar outcome: defining an endpoint that responds to web requests at a specific route.

The Lambda Function class is not decorated with any attributes. A method should take in a request object and an `ILambdaContext` object. This method should also return a corresponding response object. Depending on the type of event you are designing your Lambda Function to respond to, you will need to use different classes for the request and response objects. AWS has published some libraries to encapsulate common structures of these various types to make them easier to build.

_AWS Lambda Function Class Anatomy_

In this book, we are using the Application Load Balancer; therefore, we used the `Amazon.Lambda.ApplicationLoadBalancerEvents` library to provide a standard implementation of our request and response objects. As you can see, we take in an `ApplicationLoadBalancerRequest` and return an `ApplicationLoadBalancerResponse`. 

If we want to implement a more complex Lambda Function that supports different functionalities or operations, we can implement our routing logic around the `ApplicationLoadBalancerRequest` object’s `Path` and `HttpMethod` properties. These correspond to the ASP.NET Framework’s route and HTTP verb attributes that decorate each controller class and its methods.

As we can see, the Cloud Architecture radically simplifies, but one trade-off is that our backend code needs to be adapted to the AWS Lambda framework. This will require development and testing efforts to transform our codebase into this new hosting model. This starkly contrasts what we explored in previous chapters, where we hosted on Virtual Machines or containerized and hosted on a Kubernetes cluster. While conforming to the AWS Lambda application model does take work, its benefits are two-fold: first, it allows us to take advantage of close to zero sunk cost, and second, it allows us to fully abstract the underlying infrastructure from us and let the AWS platform take care of scalability and high availability. This allows us to focus more on the functionality of our solutions rather than the plumbing required to keep the lights on.
