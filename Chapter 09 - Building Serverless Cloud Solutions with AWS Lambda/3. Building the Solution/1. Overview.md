# Overview

Now that we have a solid design for our solution, we can begin building it. As discussed in the previous section, because weâ€™ll be using AWS serverless offerings like AWS Simple Storage Service (S3) and Lambda Functions to host our application, we will need to make some changes to our application code. We have never had to do this in Chapters 7 and 8 as we were able to deploy our application to the cloud by packaging it in either a Virtual Machine image (using Packer) or in a container image (using Docker). Therefore, we need to write some Terraform and update our application code in C# to build our solution.
