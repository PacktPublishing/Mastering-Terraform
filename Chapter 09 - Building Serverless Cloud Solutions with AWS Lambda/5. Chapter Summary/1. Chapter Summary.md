# Chapter Summary

In this chapter, we embarked on an ambitious journey, transitioning from a .NET solution previously architected on virtual machines (VMs) and Kubernetes using Amazon EKS to a fully serverless architecture utilizing AWS Lambda Functions. This transformative step involved converting our traditional .NET REST API into a suite of Lambda Functions and hosting the front end as a static website on Amazon S3, marking a significant evolution in our cloud-native development journey for our fictional company's autonomous vehicle fleet operations platform.

As we conclude this chapter, we have built three (3) distinct solutions on AWS—spanning VMs, Kubernetes, and now Serverless architectures—and we’ve demonstrated our ability to navigate and leverage AWS’s diverse capabilities to meet our evolving needs.

Looking ahead, we are poised to embark on a new chapter of our cloud journey with Microsoft Azure. Under the guidance of our elusive and visionary CEO, Keyser Söze, who has now forged a partnership with Microsoft, we stand at the threshold of exploring similar architectures in the Azure ecosystem. With our sights now set on Azure, I invite you to continue our journey as we enter this 'alternate universe,' ready to tackle new challenges and uncover new possibilities on a completely different cloud platform.
