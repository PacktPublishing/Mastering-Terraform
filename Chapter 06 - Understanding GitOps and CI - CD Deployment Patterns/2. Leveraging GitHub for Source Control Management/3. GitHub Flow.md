# 3. GitHub Flow

As we’ve discussed, GitHub Flow is the little brother of GitFlow. It’s much more simple and lightweight and perfect for small teams or experimentation. It focuses on only one branch—`main`- with new features being introduced for individual `feature/*` branches. Developers create feature branches from `main`, work on their changes, and then submit pull requests to merge them back into the `main` branch. Releases are often tagged from `main` after thorough testing.

_GitHub Flow: for small teams or experiments_

The main differences is that there is no official process around creating staging branches like `develop` or `release` branches where integration testing is performed. The responsibility for integration testing resides on the individual developer of the feature within their own `feature` branch—in essence, taking individual responsibility for their changes working in production. 

This also means that we have fewer key events which a CI / CD pipeline will trigger from. We only have a Pull Request from `feature/*` into `main` and then merge into `main` to trigger events. Additional testing can be performed on the `feature/*` branches themselves or teams can optionally introduce a manual trigger for a production release which allows for more time to perform testing on `main`.

As mentioned previously, GitHub Flow is great for smaller teams that don’t have dedicated teams focused on integration testing!
