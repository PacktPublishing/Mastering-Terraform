# 2. GitFlow

GitFlow is one of the most popular branching models and workflows used by development teams around the world. Its prolific nature has led to the development of different variations and adaptations to suit different development environments and teams’ preferences. At its core, GitFlow leverages a `main` branch to indicate production quality code and a `develop` branch that grants development teams a safe place to merge and perform integration testing.

In GitFlow, `main` is the main branch representing the production-ready code. Only code that is ready for production should live in this branch. Features that are under development are created by individual developers on their own `feature/*` branch and then merged into a shared `develop` branch that acts a bit like a staging environment before being merged into `main`.

However, as mentioned before, GitFlow is highly customizable and there have been several extensions to this core model developed over the years with varying levels of adoption.

Sometimes, `release` branches are used for preparing and testing releases, starting from `develop` and merging back into both `develop` and `main`. This can give a team greater control over when and how they release a set of features into production.

The real world happens fast. As a result, sometimes critical changes need to be made rapidly to production to fix a specific issue. That’s when `hotfix` branches are used by starting from `main` and merging back into both `develop` and then `main` once a hotfix has been fully tested.

_GitFlow is highly customizable_

1. `main`: Production Only Code
2. `release`: Release Staging
3. `develop`: Integrating Testing
4. `feature/*`: Feature Development
5. `hotfix/*`: Critical Patches to Production

GitFlow does not dictate a specific versioning scheme, but it is common to use semantic versioning (e.g., `{MAJOR}.{MINOR}.{PATCH}`) to indicate the significance of changes made in each release. GitFlow does provide clear separation of tasks, making it suitable for larger teams and projects that require strict control over the development and release process. However, this structure can be overwhelming for smaller teams or experimental projects.

_GitFlow Integration with CI / CD pipelines_

The GitFlow process has several key events where automation might be triggered. 

1. **Feature Integration**: Developer submits a Pull Request from their `feature/*` branch into \`develop\`\`. This often triggers a CI / CD pipeline that includes application code built-in quality, Unit, and Integration Tests. The merge of this Pull Request initiates a release pipeline that is deployed to the Development Environment.
2. **Feature Releases**: The team lead submits a Pull Request from the `develop` branch into `release`. This usually includes additional testing, such as System and even End-to-End Tests. The merge of this Pull Request initiates a release pipeline that deploys to the Staging or Release Environment.
3. **Production Releases**: Release Manager submits a Pull Request from `release` into `main`. This usually includes additional variations of End-to-End tests that check performance or load and may include upgrade or version testing. The merge of this Pull Request initiates a release pipeline that deploys to the Production Environment.
4. **Critical Patch**: Developer submits a Pull Request from a `hotfix/*` branch into `main`. This would likely execute a smaller catalog of test suites but would likely include version or upgrade testing. The merge of this Pull Request initiates a release pipeline that deploys to the Production Environment.

It's important to point out that this is probably the most extensive configuration of GitFlow, but humans being humans, I'm sure somebody out there has come up with an even more complex incarnation of GitFlow. In the next section, let's look at something a little more simple and lightweight by going back and taking a look at Trunk-Based Development using GitHub Flow.
