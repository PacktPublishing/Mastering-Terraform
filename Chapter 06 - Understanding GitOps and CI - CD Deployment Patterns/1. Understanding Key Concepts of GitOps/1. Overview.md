# 1. Overview

GitOps is a contemporary approach to software development and operations that strives to make the management of infrastructure and applications easier and more efficient. It achieves this by using Git as the primary source of truth and adopting a declarative approach wherever possible. This methodology integrates the principles of version control and continuous delivery to optimize the software development lifecycle and facilitate better teamwork between development and operations teams—and sometimes a fusion of the two disciplines into a true “DevOps” team.
