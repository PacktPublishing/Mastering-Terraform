# 3. Understanding CI / CD

A CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) pipeline is an automated set of steps and processes that help software development teams build, test, and deploy their applications quickly and reliably. It is a fundamental component when implementing a GitOps process as it takes on the critical role of facilitating the continuous flow of changes from development to production, ensuring that new code is automatically integrated, tested, and delivered to end-users as a working system.

_Anatomy of a Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment Pipeline_


As its very name might suggest, a CI / CD pipeline actually consists of two processes that are stitched together. First the Continuous Integration pipeline which is responsible for building and ensuring the built-in quality of the application code of the system. Second, the Continuous Deployment pipeline which is responsible for deploying that application code into its environment.

The CI/CD pipeline aggregates these two historically distinct processes: Integration Testing and Deployment. However, by combining them, it provides a systematic and automated approach to continuously delivering new features and bug fixes to users, reducing the time and risk associated with manual deployments. This, in turn, fosters a culture of collaboration, frequent feedback, and rapid innovation within development teams. 

A CI/CD pipeline that uses Terraform to provision infrastructure and deploys the latest code version to that infrastructure typically has two objectives. First, produce a version of the software that has been tested and verified to have satisfactory levels of built-in quality. Second, provision an environment—whatever that looks like—to host the application that is compatible and meets the software’s requirements to function correctly and efficiently. The third and final step is to deploy the application to that environment.

The pipeline makes no judgments about how robust your cloud architecture might be. Depending on your needs, you may opt to sacrifice certain qualities of your solution architecture for expediency or cost. The pipeline’s job is to provision whatever environment you tell it you need and to deploy the software to that environment, so once the pipeline has completed, your application is ready to accept incoming traffic from users.

In the next section, we’ll dig deeper into the internal structure of a CI / CD pipeline and discuss the mechanics of what is going on along the way.
