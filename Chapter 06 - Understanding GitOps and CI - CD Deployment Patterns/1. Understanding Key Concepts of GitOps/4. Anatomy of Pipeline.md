# 4. Anatomy of Pipeline

In the previous sections, we learned about the fundamental principles of GitOps and that the CI/CD pipeline is grounded on a version control system like Git, where developers commit their code changes. We can configure a CI / CD pipeline to trigger when certain key events take place within the codebase, such as changes being pushed to a specific branch.

Once certain key events take place within the version control system, such as a developer pushing changes to a particular branch or path, the CI / CD pipeline is triggered. It will pull the latest code, build the application, and run a series of automated tests to verify the functionality and integrity of the application code.

_Anatomy of a Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment Pipeline_

Various tests, including unit tests, integration tests, and sometimes even acceptance tests, can be conducted to ensure that the code meets quality standards and does not introduce regressions. 

Unit Tests operate on individual components and use mocks to isolate the tests’ outcomes around a single component by injecting placeholders for the component’s downstream dependencies.

_Unit Tests are isolated on a single component_

Integration Tests operate across two or more components. They can use mocks or not, and their focus is on the reliability of interactions between components. Sometimes, for very intricate or complex components, you might want integration tests that focus on the various use cases surrounding them while keeping other components’ outputs predictable using mocks.

_Integration Tests are focused on two or more components and how they interact_

System Tests introduce real-world dependencies, such as databases or messaging subsystems, into the mix and allow you to achieve much more realistic coverage across a system without fully deploying it.

An end-to-end test is one where you provide the entire host environment for the application—as it would be in production—and execute tests that mimic an actual client application or end user as closely as possible.

It depends on the requirements of the particular application and organization, what kind of testing, and how much it needs to be done on an application. Terraform can also play a crucial role in the Continuous Integration process by provisioning Just-In-Time (JIT) Environments for System or End-to-End Testing environments. Terraform allows you to dynamically create an environment fit for purpose, execute your tests and then shut everything down.

Depending on the level of reliability that you want in your release process, you could opt for a deeper and more robust level of testing before the continuous deployment process is initiated.

After the Continuous Integration process is successfully completed, the application is packaged into a deployment package (e.g., a Docker container or a JAR file) that contains all the necessary dependencies and configurations and is ready to be deployed.

During the continuous deployment process, both the Git source code and this deployment package are used to provide the environment and deploy the package to the target environment. Terraform is crucial in provisioning or updating the required infrastructure, such as virtual machines, containers, or server-less resources. As we looked at in the previous chapters, Terraform can also optionally perform the application deployment through a pre-built Virtual Machine image or a Kubernetes deployment with pre-built container images.

After deployment, the CD pipeline can run additional verification tests to ensure that the application runs correctly in the target environment by utilizing health checks built into the application and infrastructure.

Regardless of the architecture, the outcome of the CD pipeline is that it applies environment-specific configurations—usually derived from Terraform outputs, which contain vital configuration details—to the artifact. Thus customizing it for the target environment. These configurations might include database connection strings, API endpoints, or other settings that differ between environments.

As you can see, Terraform plays an essential role in this process but is not the only player on the field. Each step in this process is equally important and plays a critical role in consistently releasing software with built-in quality. In this book, we will review three architectures and three corresponding techniques for deployment for each of the three paradigms of cloud hosting: Virtual Machine, Containers, and Serverless. These solutions will be built using GitHub as the source control repository and GitHub Actions as the tool we use to implement our CI / CD pipelines. Depending on the architecture of the software and how it is hosted within the environment, the deployment technique may vary.
