# 1. Chapter Summary

In this chapter we learned the basic concepts of source control management. Including detailed breakdowns of different branching and workflow strategies that are used by teams large and small. We looked at how our automation systems, namely our CI / CD pipelines, would integrate with these processes at key events.

In the next chapter, we will move conceptual knowledge and start working on our first solution, which is to leverage virtual machines on the first public cloud, Amazon Web Servicesâ€”or AWS.
