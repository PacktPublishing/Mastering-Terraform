# 2. Docker

In Chapter 8, we go into great detail about each step of the GitHub Actions Workflow that executes Docker to build, tag, and push our Docker container images. Thanks to the nature of Docker's cloud-agnostic architecture, this overwhelmingly stays the same. 

The only thing that changes is that Google Cloud encapsulates a Service Accountâ€™s credentials into a JSON file that is downloaded from the Google Cloud Console rather than a secret string like on AWS or Azure. As a result, much of the Google Cloud tooling is setup to look for this file at a specific path location. 

Therefore, we need to use a special username `_json_key` and reference the value of the JSON file stored in a GitHub Actions secret.

```
    - name: Login to Google Container Registry
      uses: docker/login-action@v3
      with:
        registry: ${{ needs.terraform-apply.outputs.container_registry_endpoint }}
        username: _json_key
        password: ${{ secrets.GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS }}
```

The only thing that changes is the way to configure Docker to target our Google Artifact Registry.
