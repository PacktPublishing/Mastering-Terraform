# 1. Overview

As we saw in the previous chapter where we built our solution using Virtual Machines on Google Cloud, we had full control over the Operating System Configuration through the Virtual Machine images we provisioned with Packer. Just as we did when we went through the same process on our journey with AWS and Azure in Chapter 8 and Chapter 11, we’ll need to introduce a new tool in order to replace Virtual Machine images with container images—Docker.

_Logical Architecture for the Autonomous Vehicle Platform_

Our application architecture, comprising a Frontend, a Backend, and a database will remain the same but we will need to provision difference resources with Terraform and harness new tools from Docker and Kubernetes to automate the deployment of our solution to this new infrastructure.

_Source Control structure of our repository_

In this solution we’ll have seven parts. We still have the application code and Dockerfiles (replacing the Packer-based virtual machine images) for both the front- and back end. We still have GitHub Actions to implement our CI / CD process, but now we have two Terraform codebases--one for provisioning the underlying infrastructure to Google Cloud and another for provisioning our application to the Kubernetes cluster hosted on GKE. Then we have the two codebases for our application’s frontend and backend.
