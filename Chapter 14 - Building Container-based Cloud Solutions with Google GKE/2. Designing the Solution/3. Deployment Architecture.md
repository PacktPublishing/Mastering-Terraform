# 3. Deployment Architecture

As we saw with the Cloud Architecture, there were many similarities between our work in Chapters 8 and 11 with Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure. The deployment architecture will mirror what we saw in those chapters as well. In the previous chapter, we’ve already seen the differences in the Terraform provider when we configured the `google` provider to provision our solution to Virtual Machines using Google Compute Engine (GCE). 

In the context of container-based architecture, the only significant difference from our deployment in the previous chapters with AWS and Azure will be the way we authenticate with the container registry and the Kubernetes cluster. It’s important to recall the deployment architectural approach outlined in the corresponding section of Chapter 8. In the next section, we’ll build the same solution on the Google Cloud Platform, ensuring we don’t repeat the same information.
