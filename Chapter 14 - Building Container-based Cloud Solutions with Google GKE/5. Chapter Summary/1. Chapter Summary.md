# 1. Chapter Summary

In this chapter, we designed, built, and automated the deployment of a complete and end-to-end solution using container-based architecture. We built onto the foundations from Chapter 13, where we worked with the foundational infrastructure of Google Cloud Networking but layered on Google Kubernetes Engine to host our application in containers. In the next and final step in our Google Cloud Platform journey, weâ€™ll be looking at Serverless architecture moving beyond the underlying infrastructure and letting the platform itself take our solution to new heights.
