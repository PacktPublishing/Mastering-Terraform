# 5. Shared Services

Finally, the most complex operating model is that of a Shared Service. In this scenario, we are combining aspects of both our Stand-Alone Application and our Shared Infrastructure. Shared Services not only has the application code base that they need to build and deploy but also has other teams within the organization that draw dependencies on them. However, unlike the Shared Infrastructure team, where those dependencies might be at the network or configuration layer, Shared Services often have dependencies at the application interface layer, embedded within the message-based protocols that the two systems use for inter-operability. The Shared Services team is likely made up of developers and testers responsible for maintaining one (or more) services within a portfolio of microservices.

Shared Services teams are commonplace at large organizations and, as a result, often operate in an environment where they may draw their own dependencies both on other Shared Services and Shared Infrastructure teams within their organization. This helps reduce the scope of responsibility of the Shared Service team as they can shed responsibilities that are picked up by Shared Infrastructure teams operating lower level infrastructure such as the Wide Area Network, Security, Logging & Monitoring as well as higher level infrastructure like Kubernetes or even shared Kafka or Cassandra clusters. 

While the distribution of this responsibility helps focus a Shared Service Teams energy on the development and maintenance of their service it also creates additional coordination effort to synchronize changes and release processes as well as versioning compatibility between both downstream and upstream services.
