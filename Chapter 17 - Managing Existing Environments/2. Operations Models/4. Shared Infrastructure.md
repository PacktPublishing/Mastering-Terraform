# 4. Shared Infrastructure

Unlike the application development team that we followed along on their journey through the multi-verse of cloud platforms and cloud computing paradigms, there is an entire engineering group that isn’t building application code, but they are still heavy users of Terraform. These teams manage an organization’s shared infrastructure. These teams might be made up of traditional infrastructure engineers that may have managed the on-premises virtualization environment, network security, or other similar realms within IT infrastructure. Depending on the size of the organization, this can be a big job, spanning many teams and organizations, each with its own scope and realm of responsibilities, or it could be a single team.

_Operating Model for a Shared Infrastructure team deploying infrastructure that supports one or more application teams within an organization_

This operating model differs from a simple project with a stand-alone application development in that where are some inherent dependencies between what this team provisions and other teams in the organization. Those external teams draw their dependencies without committing to any type of operating model that conforms to the Shared Infrastructure Team’s. Therefore, these teams might not be using Terraform or any automation for that matter.

The environments that they are managing could be a shared network, centralized monitoring and logging, databases, data lakes, data warehouses, or even pools of shared compute such as Kubernetes clusters. In most scenarios, they won’t have their own application code, but they will often have their own deployment packages—whether these are Virtual Machine or Container images of their own creation or 3rd Party Commercial Off-the-Shelf (COTS) Software packages provided to them by software vendors either through a commercial or open source relationship.

In large organizations, Virtual Machine and Container Image repositories themselves are usually built and managed as shared infrastructure that are built and maintained by a Platform Team to be reused across the organization.

These workloads will likely also have multiple environments but may not have as many as an application development team and may opt to delineate environments simply by a Non-Production / Production dimension. This approach enables maximum reuse for Non-Production workloads and reduces the overhead of further fragmenting the shared infrastructure for every use case that dependent teams might have.

The deployment process is simplified due to the absence of application code, but shared infrastructure teams should carefully consider how to organize their Terraform Workspaces to minimize friction between the external teams, which draw dependencies on them. This is where blast radius plays an important role in the design and segmentation of Shared Infrastructure workloads into discrete and manageable Terraform workspaces.
