# 1. Chapter Intro

It is fitting that the capstone of this book is actually managing your environments with Terraform as that is probably the most important operational aspect of our solutions’ infrastructure: managing it. All too often, infrastructure-as-code is used as an expedient way to turn meters and blast solutions into the cloud without a thought given to what would happen the next day and everyday going forward. 

This “Day 1 Ops” mindset is rampant, and while understandable from a psychological standpoint, the people working with infrastructure-as-code are inherently builders. We love building new things and are constantly looking for ways to improve how we do so. But I will argue that one of the most important (and often neglected) design considerations for infrastructure-as-code solutions is not scalability, performance, security, or even high availability—it’s operability. 

Can we effectively operate our environments without outages and delays that can impact the health of our environments and ultimately the commitments we make to our customers? If the answer is, no, then we have failed as infrastructure-as-code developers, cloud engineers and cloud architects.

In this chapter, we will look at how we can infuse infrastructure-as-code with processes and techniques empowered by Terraform to achieve these goals.
