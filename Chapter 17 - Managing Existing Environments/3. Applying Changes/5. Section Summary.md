# 5. Section Summary

As we saw in this section, even when change is planned, things can be challenging. There are changes to the modules we build and consume in our solutions, there are changes to the design and capabilities of the cloud services we employ, which translates into changes within the individual resources we use, and finally, there are changes to the Terraform executable itself. And these are only changes that we plan and control! Additional changes can come in the form of unexpected outages within the Availability Zones or Regions where our solutions are deployed. In the next section, weâ€™ll look at how we can respond to unexpected errors and perform some routine break-fixing.
