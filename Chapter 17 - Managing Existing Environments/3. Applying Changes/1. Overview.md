# 1. Overview

When we manage a long-lived environment, it’s inevitable that we will have to eventually make changes to that environment—whether they are large or small. Change happens. It can be a change related to our solution itself, or it can be a change needed due to upgrades to our tools and the underlying platform itself. It can be expected—like planned releases—or unexpected—like zone or regional outages. In this section, we’ll look at all of the different types of changes that often happen to our environments and how we should best handle them while managing our environments using Terraform.
