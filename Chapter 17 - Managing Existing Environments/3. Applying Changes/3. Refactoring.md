# 3. Refactoring

As we develop more advanced configurations, we can often find ourselves in a situation where there are components of our module—whether its a root module or a reusable module—that can be ideally extracted into their own module because they implement a repeatable pattern that could be reusable in a more granular context in other modules and other deployments. 

It is in these situations that we will likely need to move resources from one module to another. If we do this within our code, any new environments that we provision immediately can reap the benefits, but our existing environments will suffer because they will detect change. The resource that we moved from one module to another will now have an entirely new path when Terraform does its plan. From Terraform’s perspective, the resource at the old location was deleted, and a new resource needs to be created at the new location. This drop-create motion creates a tremendous amount of disruption when managing existing environments. 

Like with the importation of resources we have to methods for moving resources. There is the command line operation `terraform state mv` and the `moved` block that we can define in our HCL configuration.

```
moved {
  from = module.foo.azurerm_network_security_rule.nsg_443
  to   = module.bar.azurerm_network_security_rule.main[0]
}
```

The command line operation is quite simple and is structured how you would expect.

```
terraform state mv SOURCE DESTINATION
```

The `SOURCE` and `DESTINATION` command line parameters corresponding to the `moved` block's `from` and `to` attributes, respectively.

Let's look at a specific example. In the chapters where we built solutions using Kuberentes we saw several resources get repeated with nearly identical configuration for both the front- and back end components of our application architecture. This consisted of three resources `kuberntes_deployment` and `kubernetes_service` and a `kubernetes_config_map`.

![Refactor Step 1][image-1]

_Visible repeating pattern of resources_

Before we can refactor this solution, we need to create a module that will replace the three repeating resources.

![Refactor Step 2][image-2]

_Construct a reusable module that can be configured to replace each of the instances of the repeating pattern_

Now that the module has been created, we need to create an instance of the module in the root module and deleting the previous resources within the repeating pattern.

![Refactor Step 3][image-3]

_Replace the loose resources with module references and moved blocks_

Finally, we create `moved` blocks that will facilitate Terraform recognizing that the resources don't need to be destroyed and re-created because they have already been provisioned but the path has changed.
