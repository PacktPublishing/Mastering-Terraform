# 4. Importing into State

In Chapter 16, we delved into the intricacies of importing existing environments that were provisioned outside of Terraform. As we continue our exploration in this chapter on managing existing environments, we encounter situations where importing resources becomes an essential tool for break-fixing within environments already under Terraform's management.

One common situation where importing resources becomes necessary, even in environments initially provisioned with Terraform, is when transient errors occur during the `terraform apply` process. These errors can lead to a peculiar state where resources are provisioned but reported as unhealthy to Terraform, causing the apply to fail. However, these resources may eventually be finished provisioning or recovered by the cloud platform later. In such instances, we are faced with the decision to delete these resources and re-run `terraform apply` or import them into the state.

Importing resources in this context serves as a form of break-fixing, akin to patching up a leak in a well-oiled machine. It allows us to reconcile the discrepancies between the actual state of our cloud environment and Terraform's understanding of it, much like how we would address apply-time failures by ensuring proper permissions, quotas, and network configurations.

Another scenario where importing might be necessary is when dealing with resources that have been manually or by an automated process created or modified outside of Terraform. This can lead to a drift between the Terraform state and the actual infrastructure, similar to how unexpected changes in cloud service limits or network settings can cause issues. This can arise from human operators working outside the bounds of our infrastructure-as-code process, or it could arise from automated systems enforcing enterprise governance standards. By importing the newly created or modified resources back into the Terraform state, we can realign our configuration with the current state of the infrastructure, ensuring that subsequent Terraform operations proceed smoothly.
