# 1. Laying the Foundation

Our team at Söze Enterprises applauds their achievement of responding to the whimsical technical course correction of their fearless leader, Keyser Söze, and marvels at their success and fortune in launching their product successfully on Amazon Web Services has used virtual machines, Kubernetes and finally serverless technology the comforting Orange complexion of the AWS Console begins to melt away when suddenly, the air fills with an eerie yet familiar sound: doodle-oo doodle-oo doodle-oo. An unexpected duo appears one with shoulder-length brown hair under a black baseball cap and a simple black T-shirt; the other, a nerdy charm with tousled blond hair, thick black-rimmed glasses, and a red and blue plaid flannel over a white Aerosmith T-shirt. They start the familiar chant: doodle-oo doodle-oo doodle-oo. Suddenly, we're transported to another world—another universe, perhaps, where Azure’s deep blue replaces AWS’s bright orange. Söze Enterprises has partnered with Microsoft for their next-generation Autonomous Vehicle platform.

Just as before, we have inherited a team from one of Söze Enterprises’ other divisions that has a strong core team of C# .NET developers, so we’ll be building version 1.0 of the platform using .NET technologies. The elusive CEO, Keyser, was seen hobnobbing with Sataya Nadella during the glitz and glamor of the Met Gala in New York City over the weekend, and word has come down from corporate that we will be using Microsoft Azure to host the platform. Since the team doesn’t have a ton of experience with containers and timelines are tight, we’ve decided to build a simple three-tier architecture and host on Azure Virtual Machines.

_Logical Architecture for the Autonomous Vehicle Platform_

The platform will need a front end, which will be a Web UI built using ASP.NET Core Blazor. The front end will be powered by a REST API back end, which will be built using ASP.NET Core WebAPI. Having our core functionality encapsulated into a REST API will allow Autonomous Vehicles to communicate directly with the platform and allow us to expand by adding client interfaces with additional frontend technologies like native mobile apps and Virtual or Mixed Reality in the future. The backend will use a PostgreSQL Database for persistent storage since it’s lightweight, industry-standard, and relatively inexpensive.
