# 1. Chapter Summary

This chapter we built a multi-tier, cloud architecture using Azure Virtual Machines with a fully operation GitFlow process and an end-to-end CI / CD pipeline using GitHub Actions.

In the next chapter, our fearless leader at Söze Enterprises will be throwing us into turmoil with some big new ideas, and we’ll have to respond to his call to action. It turns out our CEO, Keyser, has been up late watching some YouTube videos about the next big thing—containers—and after talking with his pal Satya on his superyacht, has decided that we need to refactor our whole solution to run on Docker and Kubernetes. Luckily, the good people at Microsoft have a service that might help us out: Azure Kubernetes Service—or AKS.
