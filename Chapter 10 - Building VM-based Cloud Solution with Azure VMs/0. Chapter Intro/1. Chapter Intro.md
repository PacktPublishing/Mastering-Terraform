# 1. Chapter Intro

Now that we have built our solution end-to-end on the Amazon Web Services platforms and followed our team’s journey from their initial Virtual Machine architecture to Kubernetes and then finally culminating with Serverless, we’re ready to switch gears and enter an alternate reality where Keyser has saddled up to his dear friends at Microsoft. In this next set of chapters, we will follow a similar path as in Chapters 7 through 9, but in this alternate version, we’ll work with Microsoft Azure.

This chapter will pick up where we started our journey on AWS; in Chapter 7, where we built a doppelgänger solution using Amazon Web Services (AWS), and in that chapter, we went into great detail about elements of the solution that are 100% cloud agnostic. This includes a detailed explanation of exactly how we use Packer to provision our .NET based Application Code to a Linux Virtual Machine and a detailed explanation of how to setup our GitHub Actions for a Virtual Machine-based CI / CD pipeline.

Since an overwhelming majority of this remains the same when we move to Azure, we won’t be revisiting these topics in this chapter at the same length. However, I would encourage you to put a bookmark in Chapter 7 and go back to reference it frequently.
