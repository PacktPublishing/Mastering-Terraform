# 1. Overview

As we saw in the previous sections of this chapter, Terraform contains extensive import mechanisms that allow us to import individuals and a multitude of existing resources into our Terraform codebase. These tools can help us overcome transient errors that result in orphaned resources that need to be managed with an existing Terraform codebase and Terraform state file. 

But what happens when we don’t have any Terraform code written and many existing resources already provisioned within our cloud landscape? Manually reverse engineering all the Terraform code from scratch doesn’t seem useful to spend our days. That’s why there are tools that help automate this process! 

In this section, we’ll examine a couple of the most popular open-source tools for solving this problem.
