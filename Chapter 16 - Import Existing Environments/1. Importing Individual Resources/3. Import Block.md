# 3. Import Block

The import command is useful and available, but it requires you to introduce change to your Infrastructure-as-Code codebase through outside influence from a human operator through the command line. The import block was introduced in version 1.5.0 of Terraform to allow these changes to be made through source code changes, which is important to maintaining a GitFlow process, which is a key component of a GitOps model.

Rather than executing a command using the Terraform Command Line Interface (CLI), youâ€™ll need to embed an import block in your codebase that looks like this:

	import {
	  to = ADDRESS
	  id = ID
	}

It looks very similar to the parameters of the Import command but it utilizes the existing context in which you execute Terraform within and uses HashiCorp Configuration Language to define.

This technique not only allows us to perform state management operations as part of our GitOps process, but it also streamlines the process. Importing resources only requires two Pull Requests: the first to introduce the Import Blocks for the resources we wish to import, and the second to remove the Import Blocks after a successful Terraform Apply, when the resources are imported into Terraform State.
