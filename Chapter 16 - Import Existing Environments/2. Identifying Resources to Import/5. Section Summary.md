# 5. Section Summary

Now that we know a bit about how to identify the existing resources and the unique identifiers that we need to map to the resources defined within our codebase, we are fully equipped to start manually importing resources into our Terraform code. But is this the only way? Is there potentially a more cost-effective or time-sensitive approach that would allow us to import resources en masse? In the next section, weâ€™ll explore some tools that allow us to find and import existing resources and generate the corresponding Terraform code that goes with them.
