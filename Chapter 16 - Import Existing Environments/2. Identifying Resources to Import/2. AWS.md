# 2. AWS

The naming convention used by AWS for EC2 instances tends to look like this: `i-abcd1234` . It typically consists of two components: the prefix and the identifier, with the prefix varying across AWS services.

The prefix `i-` indicates this is an EC2 instance (Elastic Compute Cloud). Other prefixes might be used for different types of resources, such as `vol-` for volumes or `sg-` for security groups.

In this case, the identifier, `abcd1234` is a unique identifier for the instance. AWS usually assigns a hexadecimal string to each instance to differentiate it from other resources. This naming convention helps users and AWS services identify and reference resources within the AWS ecosystem. You’ll need to recognize the correct unique identifier for whatever resource you are trying to import into Terraform from AWS and the other cloud platforms.

When using the import command on AWS, it would look like this:

	terraform import aws_instance.foo i-abcd1234

The corresponding import block would look like this:

	import {
	  to = aws_instance.foo
	  id = i-abcd1234
	}

It’s important to understand the distinction between the address, which is the internal object reference within Terraform, and the unique identifier, which is the external reference to the resource on the target cloud platform. This understanding will help you navigate the import process more effectively.
