# 3. Sometimes Moving Slow is Moving Fast

As an alternative to using an import tool to import resources on masse, you could use a lightweight technique using built-in import tools. This process is a bit tedious, but moving slowly sometimes allows you to be more purposeful and thoughtful. This process involves simply using querying techniques to identify the resources you plan on importing and then scaffolding them using the most bare-bones Terraform resource definition. This resource definition is merely a placeholder and is very unlikely to match the configuration of the previously provisioned resource—but that’s not the point. 

The point is to import the existing resource into the state and then run a `terraform plan` to determine the configuration differences. You can then use the resulting plan to adjust the resource definition’s configuration in code to match the output from the plan until there are no changes required. 

With this approach, you are taking the opposite approach to bulk tool-based import. Rather than wielding a machete and traipsing through the jungle, you wield a scalpel and make extremely thoughtful cuts. You will have to manually configure it, but it will give you a more systematic and step-by-step understanding of the components you are importing and bringing under management. This deeper understanding can help you identify dependencies and flaws in your design that might get swept under the rug when following a bulk import process.
