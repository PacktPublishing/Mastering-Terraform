# 1. Overview

We’ve looked at the built-in capabilities within Terraform to import individual resources and how, on different cloud platforms, we can identify the existing resources we want to import. We recognized some of the limitations of the built-in capabilities and looked at 3rd party alternatives that offer options of importing entire environments en masse and the current limitations of such options. Now, we’ll look at best practices on how and when to use these different approaches to import existing resources and environments to bring them under the management of Terraform.
