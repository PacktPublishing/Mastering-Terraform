# 5. Conclusion

In this section, we discussed some important rules of thumb for importing existing resources and environments under Terraform management. If you plan on performing bulk imports, first recognize the limitations of the tool you will use and build in ample time for refactoring. Most importantly, make sure that you narrow the focus by defining a focused blast radius around your deployments.

If combing through a mountain of junk code and cleaning it all up through extensive refactoring doesnâ€™t sound like your cup of tea, consider moving slowly by either reconstructing the environment through a highly focused step-by-step import process or going all the way and planning a Blue / Green deployment. My preferred method is Blue / Green, but you must carefully assess the impact on production environments to determine if this is the best option for you.
