# 1. Chapter Intro

Are you ready? We are about to turn the page on Microsoft Azure—but only after we take the final step of transitioning our application to Serverless architecture. Like we did on the Amazon Web Services platform, in the last two chapters, we worked hard to implement our solution on Microsoft Azure using Virtual Machines and then containers.

We’ve taken time to do some comparisons between how things work on Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure to help us understand the subtle and sometimes not-so-subtle differences between the cloud platforms.

We’ve noticed that while our Terraform code has been changing pretty consistently between cloud platforms, our application code and the Operating System configuration—either in Packer or Docker haven’t. As we take our final step with Microsoft Azure we’ll be going through a similar process when we went through when we transitioned our application to AWS Lambda. We’ll have to completely refactor the application code.
