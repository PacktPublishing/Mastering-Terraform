# 3. Application Code

Azure Functions are inherently event-based. Each Azure Function is triggered by a different type of event, and the Azure Functions SDK provides an extensible framework for triggering based on different types of events. Azure Functions has implemented a number of different triggers for all sorts of different Azure services, which makes it easy to design Azure Functions that can respond to all sorts of different activities taking place within your Azure environment. For the purposes of this book, we’ll focus on the HTTP Trigger only, but if you are interested, I’d recommend you go check out all the other options that Azure Functions has—it’s quite extensive.

_ASP.NET MVC Controller Class Anatomy_

In a traditional ASP.NET REST API solution, you have Controller Classes that embody a specific route and then methods that implement different operations at that route. The Controller Class needs to be decorated with an `ApiController` attribute informing the ASP.NET runtime that this class should be used to process incoming web requests at the route specified in the `Route` attribute.

Each method is decorated with an attribute that denotes which HTTP Verb the method should respond to. In the above example, we use `HttpGet`, but there are corresponding attributes for each of the supported HTTP Verbs. The method can take strongly typed parameters that can either be part of the route, the Query String, or the request body. The method returns an `IActionResult` by default, which allows us to return different data structures depending on the outcome of the request.

In order to implement a REST API using Azure Functions we need to implement a class using the Azure Function SDK. This requires us to slightly adjust how we implement both our class and our method. We will employ different class and method attributes in order to achieve a similar outcome: defining an endpoint that responds to web requests at a specific route.

_Azure Function Class Anatomy_

The Azure Function class is not decorated with any attributes. Only the methods should be decorated with a `FunctionName` attribute, which will correlate them with a named scope for the Azure Function framework. This attribute is similar to the `Route` attribute as it informs the base route of all of the methods implemented within this named context of Azure Functions. Azure Function Classes can be implemented as static or non-static classes. I'd recommend using non-static classes as they allow you to use dependency injection to greatly improve the testability of your Azure Functions.

The methods in an Azure Functions Class are where we tie into the event-triggering framework of Azure Functions. When responding to a web request, we need the first parameter of our method to be of type `HttpRequest`, and we need to use the `HttpTrigger` attribute on this method parameter. Since we decorated the method with the `FunctionName` attribute already, the Azure Functions framework knows to interrogate this method for any available event triggers. Hence, supplying the `HttpRequest` with the `HttpTrigger` attribute attached will meet the match criteria, and Azure Functions will wire up this method to respond to incoming web traffic accordingly.

This pattern is very similar to the traditional ASP.NET implementation using controller classes. However, it takes on a slightly different structure. All the same anatomical elements are there but just in different places: HTTP verb, route to the endpoint, input parameters (either Query String or on the Request Body), and the Response Body.

Unlike in a traditional ASP.NET project, the HTTP Verb is not a method-level attribute. It’s a parameter of the `HttpTrigger` attribute. The method does allow us to add additional input parameters as either Query String or part of the route but not part of the Request Body itself.

As we can see, the Cloud Architecture radically simplifies, but one trade-off is that our backend code needs to be adapted to the Azure Functions framework. This will require development and testing efforts in order to transform our codebase into this new hosting model. This stands in stark contrast to what we explored in previous chapters, where we hosted on Virtual Machines or containerized and hosted on a Kubernetes cluster. While conforming to the Azure Functions model does take work, its benefits are two-fold: first, it allows us to take advantage of close to zero sunk cost, and second, it allows us to fully abstract the underlying infrastructure from us and let the Azure platform take care of scalability and high availability. This allows us to focus more on the functionality of our solutions rather than the plumbing required to keep the lights on.
