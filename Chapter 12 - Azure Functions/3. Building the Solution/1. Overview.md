# 1. Overview

Now that we have a solid design for our solution, we can begin building it. As we discussed in the previous section, because weâ€™ll be using Azure serverless offerings like Azure Storage and Azure Functions to host our application, we will need to make some changes to our application code. This is something that we have never had to do in Chapters 10 and 11, as we were able to deploy our application to the cloud by packaging it in either a Virtual Machine image (using Packer) or in a container image (using Docker). Therefore, in order to build our solution, we need to write some Terraform and make updates to our application code in C#.
