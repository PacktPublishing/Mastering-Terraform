# 2. Cloud Architecture

In Chapter 10, our cloud-hosting solution was a set of dedicated Virtual Machines, and in Chapter 11, it was a set of shared Virtual Machines within our Kubernetes cluster’s node pool. Using virtual machines has the most sunk cost, whether they are standalone VMs or part of a Kubernetes node pool. 

In Chapter 11, our entire solution was executed on containers that allowed the front end and the back end to coexist as a set of containers on the same Virtual Machines. This saved some money, but we still needed servers to host the workload. In this chapter, we have a new objective: take advantage of the power of the cloud by leveraging cloud-native services that abstract the underlying infrastructure from us and allow us to truly pay for only what we use. Azure's serverless offerings will be crucial to us in this endeavor.

## Frontend
In previous chapters we hosted our Frontend on public facing servers that return the HTML and JavaScript that composed our web application and we still required a cloud-hosted solution to host the files and respond to requests. 

However, due to the nature of the web application running within the end user’s browser we really don't need to use cloud-hosted Virtual Machines to host what are essentially flat files. We can use simple cloud storage to host the frontend as a static web site and rely on the cloud platform to shoulder the burden of returning the web content. 

We can use Azure Storage service on Azure. This service has several different storage capabilities built into it, but for our static website, we'll be using Blob Storage. Blob Storage allows us to host static web content that is internet accessible, and Azure Storage handles all the load balancing, SSL termination, and scaling up to meet huge spikes in demand.

_Azure Storage handles web page requests, Azure Functions handles REST API requests_ 

In order to do this, we'll need to have an Azure Storage Account and enable the static websites feature. This will create a special storage container called `$web` where we can publish the web content to. All Azure Storage accounts have an internet accessible public domain. When we activate the static websites feature of Azure Storage, internet traffic gets routed to content hosted in the `$web` storage container.

This will give us a huge advantage because Azure Storage has absolutely no sunk costs. When you create an Azure Storage account, it costs you absolutely zero dollars ($0) per month. Like other serverless offerings, it uses a set of micro-transactions to measure your activity and charge you for precisely what you use. In Azure Blob Storage, this can be a bit complicated as there are several measurements that incur costs.

| Metric             | Unit         | Scale  | Price   |
| ------------------ | ------------ | ------ | ------- |
| Storage            | GBs          | 1,000  | $0.0518 |
| Read Transactions  | Transactions | 10,000 | $0.004  |
| Write Transactions | Transactions | 10,000 | $0.1125 |
| Other Operations   | Transactions | 10,000 | $0.004  |

The table above shows all the costs you will run into when using Azure Storage to host your static websites. The pricing I chose is the most expensive option with Geo-Redundant, Zone-Redundant Storage with additional Read-only access in an alternate Region. The prices listed are at time of writing for Azure's West US 2 region, prices may have changed by the time you are reading this so its best to check the latest prices for the most accurate cost estimation. 

I included these prices to make a point. We can host a static website on a three-node Kubernetes cluster for approximately $300 a month or we can host a static website on Azure Storage for less than $0.01 a month on the most rock solid storage tier that Azure has to offer. Which approach would you choose?

## Backend
Like our Frontend, in previous chapters, our Backend was also hosted on Virtual Machines in two different ways: dedicated Virtual Machines and shared Virtual Machines within the node pool on our Kubernetes cluster.

Unlike the front end, our back end doesn't have the option of running entirely client-side inside the end user's web browser. In the Backend, we have custom code that needs to run on a server. Therefore, we need to find a solution to host these components without all the overhead of a fleet of Virtual Machines.

On Azure, we can use Azure Functions to accomplish this. Azure Functions is a managed service that allows you to deploy your code without paying the sunk costs for any of the underlying Virtual Machines. Like Azure Storage, it has its own micro-transactional pricing model that charges you for precisely what you use.

| Metric           | Unit         | Scale     | Price     |
| ---------------- | ------------ | --------- | --------- |
| Execution Time   | GB/s         | 1         | $0.000016 |
| Total Executions | Transactions | 1,000,000 | $0.020    |

_Azure Functions micro-transactional pricing_

The above table shows the costs that you will incur when deploying your code to Azure Functions. The first thing that you'll probably notice is that, like Azure Storage, these prices are extremely small but that they measure a very small amount of activity on the platform.

For example, the Execution Time metric has a unit of `GB/s` which is the amount of memory, in Gigabytes, your Azure Function uses per second. Given that it measures at a 'per second' interval, you don't have to be running your Azure Functions very long to rack up quite a few of these.

The Total Executions is a rather simple metric that seemingly has no constraints, but Azure Functions have natural constraints built into them. For example, each of these executions is limited to ten (10) minutes. Now, if you are trying to respond to requests from a web application, you probably won’t want to design your Azure Function to take 10 minutes anyway, as this would be a pretty poor experience for the end user using the Web Browser. In this scenario, you want your Azure Function to return in no more than a few seconds. However, Azure Functions can be employed for many different tasks besides responding to HTTP requests from a browser, and sometimes it makes sense to run long-running activities. For those situations, you can opt to host your Azure Functions on a Premium Azure Functions Service Plan. This removes the execution length duration because rather than paying per transaction, you are essentially reserving capacity.

Azure Functions have multiple hosting options. There is the Premium Service Plan that we discussed previously, which allows you to reserve capacity, connect to private networks, remove the ten (10) minute cap on Azure Function execution duration, and allow your Azure Functions to run up to sixty (60) minutes. These Premium plans have sunk cost as you are pre-allocating Azure resources to ensure your Azure Functions operate at maximum performance. You can even select different hardware configurations (CPU and memory) to better fit your workload needs.

_Azure Functions are deployed to Function Apps which are hosted on App Service Plans_ 

In stark contrast, there is the Consumption Service Plan, which has no sunk cost but more constraints on usage and no control over scaling and resource configuration of the host environment. The consumption Service Plan is a good place to do development and testing, but if you’re going to run production workloads, I’d highly recommend sticking with a Premium Service Plan.

Previously, our ASP.NET REST API was set up using a traditional ASP.NET project that used Controllers to implement the REST API endpoints. However, when transitioning to Azure Functions, this solution structure is incompatible with the Azure Functions framework. In order to be able to host our REST API as Azure Functions, we need to conform to the framework that Azure Functions dictates. This means that the ASP.NET controller classes will need to be refactored in order to conform to this standard. In the next section, we’ll delve into the code that makes this possible.
