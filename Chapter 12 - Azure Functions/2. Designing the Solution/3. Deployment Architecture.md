# 3. Deployment Architecture

Now that we have a good idea of what our Cloud Architecture is going to look like for our solution on Azure, we need to come up with a plan for how to provision our environments and deploy our code.

In Chapter 10, when we deployed our application to Virtual Machines, we baked our compiled Application Code into a Virtual Machine image using Packer. Similarly, in Chapter 11, when we deployed our application to containers on our Kubernetes cluster, we baked our Application Code into container images using Docker. With serverless, this completely changes because Azure's serverless offerings completely abstract away the Operating System. This means that all we are responsible for is producing a compatible deployment package.

## Creating the Deployment Package

As we discussed in the previous section, we have two components of our application: the front end and the back end. Each has a different deployment target. For the front end, we are going to be deploying as a static website, while the back end is going to be deployed as an Azure Function. Since both are .NET projects, we will be using both .NET and Azure platform-specific tools in order to create deployment packages and deploy them to their target Azure services. The diagram below shows the process we go through in order to provision our environment, package our application code, and deploy it to the target environment out in Azure.

For the front end, this means enabling the feature to deploy our ASP.NET Blazor web application as a Web Assembly. This will allow the front end to be hosted as a static website that can run completely client-side without any server-side rendering. This is only possible because of the way we have designed our front-end web application, which uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to interact with server-side REST APIs. It's important to note that ASP.NET Blazor supports both hosting options, but we specifically chose to go down the client-side-only path and eliminate any dependency on server-side page rendering. As a result, when we use the .NET CLI to publish our ASP.NET Blazor project, it will emit a folder containing static web content. Then, using the Azure CLI, we can upload the contents of this folder to our Azure Blob Storage Accountâ€™s `$web` container to complete the deployment.

For the Backend, again using the .NET CLI we need to publish our project. This will emit all the files needed to properly inform the Azure Functions service to know about our little Azure Function. Once this is done, we need to zip this folder up into a zip archive. Finally, we can use the Azure CLI to deploy this zip archive to our Azure Function.
