# 1. Chapter Summary

In this chapter, we designed, built, and automated the deployment of a complete end-to-end solution using serverless architecture using Azure Functions. To accomplish this, we finally had to make some major changes to our application code to conform to the requirements of the serverless runtime. When adopting serverless offerings, one must make this distinct and considerable decision, as it tightly couples your application code with the target cloud platform.

Throughout this journey, we have meticulously constructed three distinct solutions on the Azure platform - utilizing Virtual Machines, Kubernetes through Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), and now, serverless with Azure Functions.

As we conclude this Azure-centric narrative, we stand on the brink of a thrilling new alternate reality. Guided by the enigmatic vision of our CEO, Keyser Soze, we are poised to embark on an adventurous collaboration with Google. This partnership is set to unfold in a realm of endless possibilities, mirroring our Azure achievements on Google Cloud. Our narrative will transition to exploring similar architectures on Google Cloud, so stay tuned as we venture into this "alternate universe" with Keyser Soze, delving into Google Cloud's offerings and continuing to innovate our solutions in cloud computing.
