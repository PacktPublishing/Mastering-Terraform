# 2. CDK

The Terraform CDK (Cloud Development Kit) is a method for developing Terraform configuration using imperative programming languages that you already know and use within your application development. Any language can be used, from Python to C# and from Typescript to Java. Any Terraform provider and Terraform modules can be used as well. It’s essentially the same thing as working with HashiCorp Configuration Language but using the programming language of your choice.

Whatever language you choose will ultimately compile down into a Terraform-compatible JSON file that is then interpreted by Terraform in a similar way as HashiCorp Configuration Language files are processed.

This option is great for existing development teams that already work with a programming language of choice and don’t want to invest energy in learning the HashiCorp Configuration Language. However, for non-developers, the HashiCorp Configuration Language is definitely the way to go as it provides a simple, functional language that is easier to adopt and already has a massive ecosystem of practitioners that are using it, asking and answering questions about it, and sharing code on public GitHub repositories that can help you along on your way.
