# 2. Closing Statement

We have traveled long, and we have traveled far. We have explored Terraform, its architecture, its capabilities, its form and function. Beyond just learning Terraform, to truly become masters of Terraform, we need to ground ourselves in the architectures and work patterns expected of us as infrastructure-as-code practitioners. That means we need a deep understanding of cloud architectures to effectively use Terraform to its fullest potential. This includes the various flora and fauna we will find in the wild—from Virtual Machines to containers to serverless—and all the surrounding ancillary resources that support those architectures. Once we have this core conceptual knowledge, we’ll be able to better navigate the multi-cloud world that we live in today and truly transcend our current cloud provider of choice to be ready for the future—whatever may come.

Thank you for coming on this journey with me. I hope you enjoyed my very focused and practical approach to mastering Terraform. I think the best way to learn is by doing, so I encourage you to go out to GitHub, clone any or all of the solutions described in this book, and get to work on finishing your journey of Mastering Terraform!
