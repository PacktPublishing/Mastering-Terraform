# 3. Section Summary

In this section, we looked at Terraform Cloud. What it offers in terms of capabilities and recognizing that, unlike more general purpose automation platforms, it is tailored specifically for infrastructure as code (IaC) management and collaboration using Terraform. Compared to these more general-purpose pipeline tools, Terraform Cloud stands out by offering features specifically designed for Terraform workflows, such as remote state management, secure variable storage, and integrated module management. This focus on Terraform-specific functionality makes it an ideal choice for teams looking to take their infrastructure-as-code processes to the next level. Next, weâ€™ll look at some other key trends to be aware of that are out of the scope of this book but should be on the radar of anyone looking to truly master Terraform.
