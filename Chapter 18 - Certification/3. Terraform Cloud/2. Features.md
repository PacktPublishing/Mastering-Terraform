# 2. Features

Terraform Cloud’s mission is about streamlining the process around managing environments with infrastructure-as-code. This will include features that handle day to day operations concerns of using Terraform, as well as more advanced capabilities related to empowering teams and scaling across larger organizations within the enterprise.

Above is a diagram showing the grouping of these capabilities across four functional areas:

1. Core Workflow Operations
2. Organization & Logistics
3. Module Management & Publishing
4. Day 2 Operations Support

We’ll explore each of these functional areas individually to get a better idea of what Terraform Cloud brings to the table.

## Core Workflow Operations

As we know, Terraform, itself is a simple command line tool that processes HashiCorp Configuration Language code, leverages a multitude of providers to generate a plan and then to execute that plan by orchestrating resource creation across multiple providers. Terraform Cloud is a multi-tenant SaaS offering that encapsulates the functionalities of the command line tool and hosts it as a managed service offering. 

As a result, a significant portion of the value of Terraform Cloud comes from, well, Terraform itself—that is—the command line tool that does all the work. However, Terraform Cloud provides many things beyond what is built into the command line tool. As a hosted service, it sits atop our version control system and acts as a pipelining tool that executes Terraform `plan` and `apply`.  In this book, we worked with GitHub Actions to integrate the Terraform command line tool into our workflows to run the core Terraform workflow, which includes `plan` and `apply`. 

Terraform Cloud's capabilities in the Core Workflow Operations category focus on providing Terraform-as-a-Service, similar to what pipeline tools like GitHub Actions do for general-purpose pipelines, but Terraform-specific. This means Terraform Cloud is essentially an automation-hosted platform that specializes in executing Terraform configurations. As a result, the service is tailored to Terraform's specific needs, including things like remote state management. However, it also includes essential features found in general-purpose pipelining tools, such as source control integration, cloud platform credential management, and secure variable storage. It also offers extension points for integration with external tools, allowing it to be integrated into broader automation orchestration. 

## Organizational

The Organizational & Logistics aspect of Terraform Cloud is designed to facilitate collaboration and management by teams within organizations large and small. It provides a structured environment to organize users, roles, and permissions across logical projects, leading to the creation and operation of Terraform workspaces—ensuring that team members have the appropriate access and permissions to perform their tasks effectively. Like other more general-purpose automation platforms like Azure DevOps and GitHub Enterprise, maintaining order and control in these collaborative environments is baseline functionality. 

## Module Management & Publishing

Terraform Cloud's capabilities within Module Management and Publishing enable teams and organizations to build, maintain, and share their own libraries of Terraform modules across their organization. As we’ve discussed, Terraform modules often encapsulate organizationally approved best practices and are often maintained by a central organization responsible for their implementation and built-in quality. Terraform Cloud supports this publishing process by integrating Terraform module testing and validation to ensure quality before new versions of Terraform modules are distributed across an organization. Additionally, these modules can be made available in no-code environments, providing a service catalog-like experience for end users. This empowers teams to standardize and scale their infrastructure management efforts but also makes the solutions that they build available to parts of the organization that are unfamiliar with infrastructure-as-code or Terraform in general.

## Day 2 Operations Support

The Day 2 Operations Support functionality in Terraform Cloud is geared towards managing and maintaining existing systems in production. It includes continuous validation to ensure environments remain up-to-date with the desired state described within the code and drift detection to identify changes made outside of Terraform code. There are also more advanced enterprise features, such as audit logging, to help larger organizations meet regulatory compliance standards and implement risk management policies to detect and prevent unplanned changes to the environment. Another key feature is the policy-as-code capabilities provided by Sentinel, which enables governance and security controls over the environments managed by Terraform Cloud.

## Pricing Tiers

The Free tier provides all infrastructure-as-code capabilities of Terraform as a hosted service out-of-the-box and all of the Core Workflow Operations capabilities—including Remote State, Secure Variable Storage, Dynamic Provider Credentials, and Source Control integration. It’s a great way to get your feet wet exploring the platform and learning the new way of working with Terraform Cloud as the foundation as opposed to a general-purpose pipeline tool. As expected, it is pretty limited with a single concurrent job and limited access to more advanced enterprise features such as Policy-as-Code and Run Tasks that are designed to help you scale Terraform Cloud into a larger, more sophisticated infrastructure-as-code powered organization. The free tier allows you to provision up to 500 resources.

The Standard tier adds Team Management and increases the number of concurrent jobs from one (1) to three (3), which probably makes sense in a team environment. The pricing model is per hour per resource, which means every resource you declare in your Terraform configuration will count toward your usage. The price per hour per resource, at the time of writing, was $0.00014. To give you an idea of how much this would cost to operate, one of the environments that I manage is an environment with a small Kubernetes cluster and all the surrounding supporting infrastructure. I provisioned exactly 110 resources in this environment using Terraform.

110 resources x $0.00014 per resources per hour = $0.0154 per hour

$0.0154 per hour \* 24 hours per day \* 30 days per month = $11.088 per month

So, for roughly eleven (11) dollars per month, I can use Terraform Cloud to manage my environment. This is in addition to what I pay for my source control management system and the cloud hosting costs of the environment.

The “Plus” tier introduces Day 2 Operations Support scenarios such as Audit Logging, Drift Detection, Continuous Validation, Ephemeral Workspaces, ServiceNow Integrations, and unlimited Policy-as-Code to help you better manage your environments and integrate with your day-to-day operations.

The “Enterprise” tier is essentially the hosted offering that allows you to deploy Terraform Enterprise into your own data center, which can be important to large enterprises that are not interested in taking advantage of the lowered operating cost of utilizing HashiCorp’s multi-tenant offering, Terraform Cloud.
