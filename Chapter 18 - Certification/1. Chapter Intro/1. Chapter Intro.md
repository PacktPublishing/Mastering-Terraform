# 1. Chapter Intro

We are at a place in our journey where we have to stop and ask ourselves—“What’s next?” Before we do that, let’s think about where we’ve been. 

We’ve learned what Terraform is and how to use it. We’ve learned some basic concepts in cloud architecture that transcend the particular cloud platform you might be using at the moment. We’ve built three sophisticated architectures on each of the three major hyperscalers—AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud—and finally, we learned how to work with existing environments. Either importing them into Terraform or managing them with Terraform as long-lived environments in production or otherwise. 

That’s a lot. It’s been quite a journey, so where do we go from here? Well, the answer is in you. I hope that means you have learned something along this journey, and you’ll take that into your day-to-day work to build amazing systems that solve real-world problems and are better equipped to build and manage them with the power of Terraform.

In this chapter, before we close, I’d like to discuss some potential next steps, both for your personal growth and extended learning. You have invested a tremendous amount of time in reading this book and have begun your journey of mastering Terraform. You may want to consider certification as a way to validate your skills and knowledge and to demonstrate your expertise to potential employers. 

Additionally, there may be other technologies that you may want to consider as you continue to deepen your mastery of Terraform. We'll explore some of these options, including tools and platforms that complement Terraform and how they can enhance your infrastructure as code capabilities. By the end of this chapter, you should have a clear roadmap for your continued learning and a solid foundation for your future endeavors in the world of cloud infrastructure management.
