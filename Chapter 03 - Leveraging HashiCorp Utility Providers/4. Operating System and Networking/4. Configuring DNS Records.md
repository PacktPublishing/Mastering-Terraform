# 4. Configuring DNS Records

Managing DNS using automation is critical for specific release strategies such as Blue-Green Deployment. Terraform provides an extensible framework that can easily handle such essential configurations. 

While most cloud providers offer their own DNS service, from Amazon’s Route 53 to Azure’s Private DNS Zones, there is usually a first-party solution for managing DNS on the cloud of your choice. Several 3rd party providers for public DNS registrars have DNS service offerings like Cloudflare, Akamai, GoDaddy, or Dyn DNS.

However, because Terraform offers such an extensible foundation, managing DNS is not limited to public cloud platforms through their respective providers. You can also manage your on-premises DNS servers or any custom DNS infrastructure built using Infrastructure-as-a-Service in your chosen public or private clouds.

You can use the `dns` Provider with any DNS server that supports either the secret key (RFC 2845) or GSS-TSIG (RFC 3645) authentication method.
