# 3. Templating Files and Directories

In the previous chapter, we covered templating files and surveyed HCLâ€™s built-in functions, including the function called `template_file`. You should use this function when working with a single file, but the `template` provider offers a resource that you can use to apply templating across all the files within a given directory.

The Resource takes input files from the `source_dir` attribute and, for each file, substitutes the specified input variables for the corresponding placeholders, writing each output file to the established `destination_dir`. Using this resource is a great way to update configurations that span a multitude of files. Still, you must stage all files with a consistent set of placeholders for the templating engine to replace in the same fashion that the `template_file()` function operates.
