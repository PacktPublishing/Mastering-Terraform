# 4. Making HTTP Requests

Sometimes, you can access data from external sources without using a local script or command line utility by directly accessing a REST API endpoint. This approach is advantageous when you want to fetch configuration information staged at a static HTTP endpoint, access information about resources managed outside of Terraform, integrate with a cloud provider or external services directly through its REST API, and integrate health checks into your Terraform process.

The `http` provider provides a single data source called `http`, allowing you to make an HTTP `GET` operation. The only required input is `url`, but you can provide several attributes you would expect to set on an HTTP request, such as HTTP request headers and body content. 

```
	data "http" "foo" {
	  url = "https://foo"
	}
```

After Terraform makes the HTTP request, you can access the HTTP response status code, headers, and body content.
