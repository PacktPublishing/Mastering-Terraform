# 1. Chapter Intro

As we discussed in the first chapter, when we learned about Terraform’s architecture, Terraform was designed to be extensible. In the last chapter, we spent a lot of time looking at the HashiCorp Configuration Language, which provides many tools that we can use to help us define our infrastructure as code. However, these language devices are not always sufficient. That is why HashiCorp has built a set of utility providers that provide a kind of base class library—or set of reusable features that are helpful for specific scenarios, no matter what cloud platforms you are building your Infrastructure-as-Code solutions.
