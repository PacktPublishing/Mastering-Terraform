# 4. Section Summary

In this section, we learned how to randomize the names of our resources using the `random` provider and even generate secrets that we can use to fully automate an environment with resources that need you to set passwords before Terraform can provision them. We also learned how we could use the `time` Provider when to use it versus the `timestamp` function we looked at in Chapter 2 and other advanced scenarios of creating time periods and windows of rotation.

Next, we'll look at some utility providers that help us overcome some limitations of Terraform whenever we encounter a situation in which Terraform doesn't already have a built-in solution or an existing Provider that tackles the problem.
