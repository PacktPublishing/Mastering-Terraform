# 1. Overview

When building our architecture with Infrastructure-as-Code, the product is not the code but living and breathing environments. While the code lives in the abstract realms of our minds, these environments operate within the real world, and just like how our best-laid plans get smashed by reality—so do our environments. 

Therefore, we need some tools to prepare our environments to meet and come to grips with reality. The `random` and `time` Providers allow us to avoid conflicts between our resources and our environments—whether it’s the name of something or when something expires. These are all critical elements of our solution design that can make or break our architecture when it encounters the real world.
