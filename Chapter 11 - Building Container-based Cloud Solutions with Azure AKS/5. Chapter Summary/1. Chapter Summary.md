# 1. Chapter Summary

In this chapter, we designed, built, and automated the deployment of a complete and end-to-end solution using container-based architecture. We built onto the foundations from Chapter 10, where we worked with the foundational infrastructure of Azure Virtual Networks but layered on Azure Kubernetes Service to host our application in containers. In the next and final step in our Azure journey, weâ€™ll be looking at Serverless architecture, moving beyond the underlying infrastructure, and letting the platform itself take our solution to new heights.
