# 2. Docker

In Chapter 8, we go into great detail about each step of the GitHub Actions Workflow that executes Docker to build, tag and push our Docker container images. Thanks to the nature of Docker's cloud-agnostic architecture, this overwhelmingly stays the same. The only thing that changes is the way to configure Docker to target our Azure Container Registry.

Like in Chapter 8, we need to connect to the container registry that we provisioned with Terraform. On Azure, that means we’ll need the Entra ID Service Principal’s Client ID and Client Secret.

```
- name: Login to Azure Container Registry
	uses: docker/login-action@v3
	with:
	registry: ${{ steps.terraform.outputs.registry_endpoint }}
	username: ${{ vars.DOCKER_ARM_CLIENT_ID }}
	password: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_ARM_CLIENT_SECRET }}
```

This Service Principal is the same identity that we configured as inputs into Terraform that provisions the infrastructure. As part of that process, the `AcrPush` Role Assignment was associated with this identity. This grants it permission to perform the following step: publishing images to our ACR.

```
- name: Build and push Docker image to ACR
	uses: docker/build-push-action@v5
	with:
	context: ${{ env.DOCKER_WORKING_DIRECTORY }}
	push: true
	tags: ${{ steps.terraform.outputs.registry_endpoint }}/${{ env.DOCKER_IMAGE_NAME }}:${{ steps.image-version.outputs.version }}
```

The above code again uses the `docker\build-push-action` to push the container image that we built in this GitHub Action to our Azure Container Registry. Like we did on AWS, we reference the outputs from the Terraform infrastructure stage in order to obtain the ACR’s endpoint.
