# 3. Deployment Architecture

As we saw with the Cloud Architecture, there were many similarities between the work that we did in Chapter 8 with Amazon Web Services. The deployment architecture will mirror what we saw in Chapter 8 as well. The differences in the Terraform provider we’ve already seen in the previous chapter when we configured the `azurerm` provider to provision our solution to Azure Virtual Machines. 

Now, using container-based architecture, the only real differences from the way we deployed in Chapter 8 with AWS will be the way we authenticate with the container registry and the Kubernetes cluster. I would encourage you to review the deployment architectural approach outlined in the corresponding section of Chapter 8. In the next section, we’ll go into the details of building the same solution on Azure, but again, we’ll take care not to re-tread the same ground.
