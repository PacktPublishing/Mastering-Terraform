# 4. Section Summary

In this section, we reviewed the key changes in our architecture as we transitioned from virtual machine-based architecture to container-based architecture. We were careful not to retread the ground we’ve covered in Chapter 8, where we went through this transformation first on the Amazon Web Services platform. In the next section, we’ll get tactical in building the solution, but again, we’ll be careful to build on the foundations we built in the previous chapter when we first set up our solution on Microsoft Azure using Virtual Machines.
