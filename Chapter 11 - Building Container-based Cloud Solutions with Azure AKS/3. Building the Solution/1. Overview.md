# 1. Overview

In this section, weâ€™ll be taking our theoretical knowledge and applying it to a tangible, functioning solution, harnessing the power of Docker, Terraform, and Kubernetes on the Microsoft Azure platform. Some parts of this process will require significant change, such as when we provision our Azure infrastructure using Terraform; other parts will have minor changes, like the Kubernetes configuration that we use to deploy our application to our Kubernetes cluster, and some will have almost no change whatsoever, like when we build an push our Docker images to our container registry.
