# 2. Docker

We go into great detail on how we implement our `Dockerfile,` which installs our .NET Application Code and runs the service in a container. If you skipped Chapters 7 through 9 due to a lack of interest in Amazon Web Services (AWS), I can’t hold that against you—particularly if your primary interest in reading this book is working on the Microsoft Azure cloud platform. However, I would encourage you to review the corresponding section within Chapter 8 to see how we use Docker to configure a Container with our .NET Application Code.
