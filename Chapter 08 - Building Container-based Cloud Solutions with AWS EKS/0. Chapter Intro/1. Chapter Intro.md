# 1. Chapter Intro

In the previous chapter, we built and automated our solution on AWS utilizing Elastic Cloud Compute—or EC2. We built Virtual Machine Images with Packer and provisioned our Virtual Machines using Terraform. In this chapter, we’ll follow a similar path, but instead of working with Virtual Machines, we’ll look at hosting our application in containers within a Kubernetes cluster. 

To achieve this, we’ll need to alter our approach by ditching Packer and replacing it with Docker to create a deployable artifact for our application. We will again be using the `aws` provider for Terraform, but this time, we’ll be introducing something new: the `kubernetes` provider for Terraform, which will provision to the Kubernetes cluster after our AWS infrastructure has been provisioned using the `aws` provider for Terraform.

Again, with this approach, we will focus on only the new and different. I'll call out where we are building on previous chapters and when something is legitimately new.
