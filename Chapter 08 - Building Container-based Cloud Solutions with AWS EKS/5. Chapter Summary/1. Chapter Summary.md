# 1. Chapter Summary

In this chapter, we designed, built, and automated the deployment of a complete and end-to-end solution using container-based architecture. We built onto the foundations from Chapter 7, where we worked with the foundational infrastructure of AWS VPCs but layered on AWS Elastic Kubernetes Service to host our application in containers. In the next and final step in our AWS journey, weâ€™ll be looking at serverless architecture, moving beyond the underlying infrastructure, and letting the platform itself take our solution to new heights.
