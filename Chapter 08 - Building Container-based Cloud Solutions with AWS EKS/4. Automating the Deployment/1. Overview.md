# 1. Overview

In this section, we shift our focus from building our application and its environment to implementing deployment automations to efficiently provision our solution to AWS. Container-based architectures involve three core deployment motions. First, the creation and publishing of container images to a container registry. Next, provisioning the Kubernetes cluster environment where containers will be hosted. Finally, deployment of Kubernetes resources that will create the containers, within Kubernetes pods and referencing the container images we published.
