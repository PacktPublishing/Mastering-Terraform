# 2. Docker

Like the virtual machine image that we built with Packer in the previous chapter, the container image acts as an immutable artifact that contains a versioned copy of the application code and Operating System configuration, we need to update this artifact anytime something changes in either the application code or the Operating System configuration.

	on:
	  push:
	    branches: 
	    - main
	    paths:
	    - 'src/dotnet/frontend/**'

Just like with Packer, we need to trigger a new container image to be built anytime the application code and the Operating System Configuration within the `Dockerfile` itself. With GitHub Actions, we can add a list of `paths` that will trigger our Workflow.

_Virtual Machine Image Versioning_

Now that we have the triggers and some variables set for our Workflow, we need to structure the `jobs`. For each Packer template, we will have two jobs: one that builds the C# .NET application code and produces a deployment package and another that runs `packer build` to produce the Virtual Machine Image.

	jobs:
	
	  build:
	    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
	    steps:
	
	      ...
	
	  packer:
	    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
	    steps:
	
	      ...

The `build` job performs a pretty standard .NET build process, which includes restoring package dependencies from Nuget (the .NET package manager), building the code, running Unit and Integration Tests, publishing a deployable artifact, and storing that artifact so that it can be used by future jobs within the pipeline.

_Docker Workflow_

The `docker` job immediately runs Terraform to obtain outputs of the ECR container repository that we want to target. We don't have to run Terraform here but alternatively we could explicitly specify the ECR repository fully qualified path.

Then, it generates a unique version of the name for the container image that will be produced if successful. We'll generate this image version based on the current date and the GitHub Action's run number. This will help keep the image version to be garaunteed unique so we don't have to manually set it or worry about conflicts when pushing to the repository.

```
    - id: image-version
      name: Generate Version Number
      run: |
        echo "version=$(date +'%Y.%m').${{ github.run_number }}" >> "$GITHUB_OUTPUT"
```

Next we need to setup Docker.

	    - name: Set up Docker Buildx
	      uses: docker/setup-buildx-action@v1

Then we'll configure our AWS credentials using an official AWS GitHub Action. We'll use an AWS Access Key and Secret Access Key specified by the GitHub Environment settings.

```
    - name: Configure AWS Credentials
      uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v4
      with:
        aws-access-key-id: ${{ vars.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}
        aws-secret-access-key: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}
        aws-region: ${{ vars.PRIMARY_REGION }}
```

Once the credential is configured we can use the `amazon-ecr-login` action to connect to the AWS Elastic Container Registry.

```
    - name: Log in to Amazon ECR
      id: login-ecr
      uses: aws-actions/amazon-ecr-login@v2
```

Finally, we'll build and push the image using an official Docker GitHub Action. It's important to note that this action is not specific to AWS. It's using standard container registry protocols to communicate with the AWS Elastic Container Registry using the fully qualified path to the ECR repository that we specify in the `tags` parameter. 

```
    - name: Build and push Docker image to ACR
      uses: docker/build-push-action@v5
      with:
        context: ${{ env.DOCKER_WORKING_DIRECTORY }}
        push: true
        tags: ${{ steps.terraform.outputs.registry_endpoint }}:${{ steps.image-version.outputs.version }}
```

Both of our application components, the front end and the back end will have their own repository so the registry endpoint will be different depending on which container image we are pushing.
