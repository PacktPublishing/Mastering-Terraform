# 4. Kubernetes

When we automate Kubernetes with Terraform we are really just running `terraform apply` again with a different root module. This time the root module will configure the `kubernetes` and `helm` providers in addition to the `aws` provider. However, we won't ever create new resources with the `aws` provider, we will only obtain data sources to existing resources we provisioned in the previous `terraform apply` that provisioned the infrastructure to AWS.

As a result, the GitHub Action that executes this process will look strikingly similar to how we executed Terraform with AWS. Some of the variables might change to include somethings like the container image details and cluster information.
