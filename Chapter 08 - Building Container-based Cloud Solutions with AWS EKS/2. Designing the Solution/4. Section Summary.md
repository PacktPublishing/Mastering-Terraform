# 4. Section Summary

In this section, we reviewed the key changes in our architecture as we transitioned from virtual machine-based architecture to container-based architecture. In the next section, we’ll get tactical in building the solution, but we’ll be careful to build on the foundations we built in the previous chapter when we first set up our solution on Amazon Web Services using virtual machines powered by EC2.
