# 3. Deployment Architecture

Now that we have a good idea of what our Cloud Architecture is going to look like for our solution on AWS we need to come up with a plan on how to provision our environments and deploy our code.

## Cloud Environment Configuration
Building upon the methodology we established in Chapter 7 for provisioning EC2 instances, our approach to provisioning the AWS EKS environment will follow a similar pattern. The core of this process lies in utilizing GitHub Actions, which will remain unchanged in its fundamental setup and operation.

_Terraform Code provisions the environment on AWS_

However, instead of provisioning EC2 instances as we did previously, the Terraform code will be tailored to set up the necessary components for an EKS environment. This includes the creation of an EKS cluster and an Elastic Container Registry (ECR). The GitHub Action will automate the execution of this Terraform code, following the same workflow pattern we used before.

By reusing the GitHub Action workflow with different Terraform scripts, we maintain consistency in our deployment process while adapting to the different infrastructure requirements of the EKS environment. This step will need to be executed in a stand-alone mode to ensure certain pre-requisites are there such as the container registry. Only once the container registry is provisioned can we build and push container images to it for our front- and back end application components.

This step will also provision the EKS cluster which hosts the Kubernetes control plane that we use in the final step in conjunction with the container images to deploy our application.

## Container Configuration
Unlike Packer, which doesn't rely on any existing infrastructure to provision the application deployment artifacts (e.g., the AMIs built by Packer), our container images need to have a container registry before they can be provisioned.

The workflow is very similar to that of Packer in that we combine the application code and a template the stores the Operating System configuration in this case a Dockerfile rather than a Packer template.

## Kubernetes Configuration
After we have published container images for both the front- and back end we are ready to complete the deployment by adding a final step that executes Terraform using the Kubernetes provider to deploy our application to the EKS cluster.

_Container Images as inputs to Terraform Code provisions the environment on EKS' Kubernetes Control Plane_

We will output key pieces of information from the previous Terraform step that provisioned the AWS infrastructure. This will include details about the ECR repositories and the EKS cluster. We can use these as inputs to the final Terraform execution step where we use the Kubernetes provider. We have separated this step into a separate Terraform workspaces to decouple it from the AWS infrastructure. This recognizes the hard dependency between the Kubernetes control plane layer and the underlying infrastructure. It allows us to independently manage the underlying infrastructure without making changes to the Kubernetes deployments as well as make changes isolated within the Kubernetes control plane which will speed up the release process.
