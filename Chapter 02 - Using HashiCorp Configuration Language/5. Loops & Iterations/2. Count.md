# 2. Count

The `count` meta-argument is Terraform's oldest method of iterating resources: an oldie but a goodie. The `count` meta-argument is excellent when you want to provision the same block multiple times and have no unique identifier to key off of. In this situation, you will use the item's index in a `list` to determine its uniqueness. This approach can pose challenges in the future if the items in the `list` need to change in such a way that would cause the indices of each item to change. 

The best way to manage this is to treat your `list` as append-only, as this will avoid replacing related resources. Adding or removing items from the middle of the `list` will cause all the items below that item to shift their index, resulting in destruction and recreation.

For example, if you want to provision a five-node cluster, you wouldn't remove a specific node from the cluster when you scale down. You would reduce the number of nodes. You don't care which nodes get removed. You only care how many there are. In this situation, it is ideal to use `count`.

```
	resource "aws_instance" "node" {
	
	  count = var.node_count
	
	  # the rest of the configuration
	
	}
```
