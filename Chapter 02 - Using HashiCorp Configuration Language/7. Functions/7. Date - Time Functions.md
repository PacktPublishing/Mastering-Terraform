# 7. Date / Time Functions

Date / Time functions provide a set of utilities for creating time stamps. These functions can help set expiration dates for short-term access tokens or transform a date time string into the correct format expected by the specific resource you use.

When working with time in Terraform, itâ€™s important to note that there is no explicit Date / Time type. Terraform handles Date / Time values using the `string` type. The default format that Terraform uses is the RFC 3339 format, which looks like this:

```
2023-09-14T13:24:19Z
```

The above value has the following format:

```
{YYYY}-{MM}-{DD}T{HH}:{mm}:{ss}Z
```

This behavior is essential to understand because all the Date / Time functions that are available will either take in or produce a timestamp in this format.
