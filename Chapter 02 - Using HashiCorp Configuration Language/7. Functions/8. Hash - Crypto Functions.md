# 8. Hash / Crypto Functions

Just like the Encoding functions, there are several options when it comes to hashing and cryptographic functions. These functions implement a variety of hashing algorithms such as MD5 and SHA and encryption algorithms like RSA. There are also corresponding file-based operations that allow you to read content from a file.

Itâ€™s important to remember that hashing is not the same thing as encryption and that when using encryption, you should secure the keys you use both in and outside of Terraform State.
