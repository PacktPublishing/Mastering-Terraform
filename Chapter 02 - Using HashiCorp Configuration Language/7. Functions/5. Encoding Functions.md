# 5. Encoding Functions

Encoding functions let you work with text of various encoding formats and convert back and forth between them. These include string-based operations like Base64 and string-to-object encoding formats like JSON and YAML. 

Many services will often require input data to be encoded in Base64 to simplify the transmission of complex data, and the two corresponding encode and decode functions work as you would expect them.

The JSON and YAML encode and decode functions work like typical serializers, with the encode functions taking in an `object` and producing a `string`â€”while the decode functions take in a `string` and produce an `object`.
