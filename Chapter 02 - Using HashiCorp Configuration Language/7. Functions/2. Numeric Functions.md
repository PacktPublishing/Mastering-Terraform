# 2. Numeric Functions

Numeric functions operate on objects of type `number`. The usual suspects are present. Everything from absolute value, ceiling/floor, min/max, etc. 

Given that these functions cover fundamental concepts in math, they are primarily outside the scope of this book. Iâ€™d encourage you to check out the excellent documentation provided by HashiCorp on these functions.
