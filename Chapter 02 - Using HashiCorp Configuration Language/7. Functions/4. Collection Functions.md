# 4. Collection Functions

Collection functions are an assortment of functions that let you work with objects of type `list` or `map`. These contain everyday set-based operations, boolean checks, and accessors.

## Length

The `length` function is probably the most common collection function. It is often used with the `count` meta-argument as it provides a simple and dynamic method for obtaining the number of items in a list. 

```
	locals {
	  fault_domains = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
	
	  fault_domain_count = length(local.fault_domains)
	}
```

In the above code, we calculate the number of fault domains using the `length` method on the `fault_domains` list. This approach will produce a value of five (5) for the `fault_domain_count` local variable.

## Range
The `range` function can be useful for taking a count and creating an array of indices for them. There are three overloads, but the most useful of the overloads is the one below:

```
	range(start, limit)
```

This overload of the `range` function takes a `start` number and a `limit` number. This capability is helpful because cloud platforms often have deployment boundaries that are important to how we structure our architecture. These boundaries significantly impact the resiliency of our architecture—such as Regions, Availability Zones, Fault Domains, etc.—so we must take them seriously. 

A common problem we face when working within and across these boundaries is that our deployments often need to be very specific about which area to target within a boundary. For example, I need to specify that my subnet is in Availability Zone 2 or that my Virtual Machine needs to be in Fault Domain 3.

The problem arises because cloud platforms often don't have a uniform or consistent way of telling us the domain of values for a particular boundary. For example, rather than giving us a list of "Availability Zone 1", "Availability Zone 2", and "Availability Zone 3"—the values we need to target our resources to the target area correctly. Instead, the cloud platform might give us a more cryptic "This region has 5 Availability Zones, Good Luck!". When we need to be specific, they are generic. This incongruence does not produce ideal outcomes. 

If we are hard coding our Resources, this would be fine. Still, when you want to provision to a dynamic list of Availability Zones, which allows you to iterate across the list of Availability Zones and provision some resources to each, you need to somehow convert a range into a discrete list of elements such that you can align each item in that list. Queue the music; here comes `range` to the rescue!

```
	locals {
	  max_fault_domains = 5
	
	  fault_domains = range(1, local.max_fault_domains)
	}
```

In the above code, let's pretend the cloud platform provided the hard-coded number of fault domains. We need to create a list that we can iterate across to provision a Virtual Machine to each of the fault domains. Thanks to `range`, we can produce the following list:

```
	fault_domains = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

With the above list, we can quickly iterate to create a Virtual Machine in the correct subnet using the `count` meta-argument and the length of the `fault_domains` list.

## Flatten
The `flatten` function can be helpful when you have homogenous data elements stored within different arrays. This situation might occur when you have a module return a collection of sub-resources.

_The Network Module each produces its list of Subnets that you need to aggregate into a single list of Subnets_

In the above diagram, we can see that we have a Module that provisions a network. This Module outputs a list of subnets. Often, we want a Module to encapsulate relevant sub-resources that are tightly coupled with the primary resource of the Module. While this approach makes the code more maintainable, it also creates difficulties upstream if we want to act uniformly across all the sub-resources it outputs. 

With `flatten`, we can collapse the list of lists into a single flattened list with each subnet as an item. Doing so will enable us to work uniformly with all of the subnets from the consuming Module we are developing.

## Transpose
The `transpose` function is also beneficial when working with hierarchies of objects with complex relationships with their children.

_Virtual Machines associated with a collection of Security Groups_

For example, in the above diagram, two Virtual Machines are associated with a collection of Security Groups. We have set up this as a `map` collection in this situation. The key would be the Virtual Machine and the value of a collection of Security Groups.

This `map` works excellent when we want to iterate over the top-level object: the Virtual Machines—but what if we're going to iterate over the child objects, the Security Groups? We flip this relationship upside down using the `transpose` function on this map!

![Resource][image-3]
_Security Groups associated with a collection of Virtual Machines_

The above diagram shows that instead of having a top-level object be the Virtual Machine, it's now the Security Groups. The transpose operation has also replaced child objects with Virtual Machines. However, you'll notice that the function has maintained the relationships between parent and child—we're just looking at the relationship through a different lens.

## Zipmap
The `zipmap` function is handy when you have two `list` objects, one containing the keys and the other containing the corresponding values. Both lists of corresponding items in the same index, and the lists must be the same length.

The name is interesting as it is an attempt at word painting. Imagine the construction of a Zipper: two independent but parallel lists of notches, but when the zipper is applied sequentially, each notch on the left side is attached to the corresponding notch on the right side.

_Virtual Machines list and a corresponding Security Group list_

In the above diagram, we have two lists, one containing Virtual Machines and another containing Security Groups. With the `zipmap` function, we can create a new `map` object that creates an association between each element in the Virtual Machine and Security Group lists.
