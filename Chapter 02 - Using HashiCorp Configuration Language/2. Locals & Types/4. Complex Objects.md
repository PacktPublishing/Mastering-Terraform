# 4. Complex Objects

The HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL) is not object-oriented; therefore, it does not have a mechanism for defining classes like other languages that represent complex types. However, it does support complex objects. It uses dynamic types, meaning Terraform will evaluate the object's type at runtime. 

Dynamic Typing can be a blessing and a curse. It is a blessing because we don't have to conform to strict structures of objects. If we need another attribute, we can quickly add it. It is a curse because it means we need an official source of truth for how the object should be structured, and we'll have to rely on reference tracing when refactoring the structure of objects passed from one module or resource to another.

```
	object = {
	  name    = "westus"
	  network = "10.0.0.0/16"
	}
```

Defining an object is as simple as declaring the object reference and setting it to the value of a blockâ€”as indicated by the `{` and `}`. This block can contain any number of primitive types, collections, or complex objects.
