# 4. Lifecycle

The `lifecycle` meta-argument is a block that can appear on any resource block and is used to alter the control of that resource's—well—lifecycle. That is the resource's creation and deletion—the birth and death. Each option allows you to handle edge cases where you want Terraform to behave differently than usual.

## Create Before Destroy

This situation reminds me of that classic movie scene from "Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark," where Indy is in a booby-trapped Peruvian temple. To acquire the golden statue, he must replace it with something. First, Indy has to create a bag of dirt to replace the golden statue. Then, he must delicately replace the golden statue with it. The situation that our hero, Indy, finds himself in is the essence of `create_before_destroy`. In these situations, you need the new thing before you get rid of the old. There are many examples of this scenario. It can apply to certificates, security groups, and the like. 

## Lock Resources

For some resources, you don't want to take a chance that a less-than-careful administrator will blow them away without thoroughly analyzing the `terraform plan`—an unfortunately common occurrence. This situation is where `prevent_destroy` comes into play. By adding this meta-argument to your resources, you are adding yet another gate the user must explicitly remove before they can destroy. Many cloud services natively support this feature, but not all. Therefore, Terraform allows you to enable this feature within your HCL code on any resource vital to the environment's health or may contain stateful data that you would lose in the case of destruction. 

## Ignore Changes

Sometimes, Terraform is one of many tools that operate in an environment, or you want to allow manual administration of a particular feature after deployment. In this case, the `ignore_changes` option will enable you to provision the resource with Terraform but ignore changes made outside of Terraform.

```
	lifecycle {
	  ignore_changes = [
	    tags
	  ]
	}
```

Ignore changes is an array of object references relative to the resource block you defined. You can imagine `this` before any reference within the list. You will get an error if you attempt to reference an external resource.

## Replace Triggered By

Many Terraform resources already know what circumstances should cause Terraform to trigger a replacement. The cause is usually a change in the value of a critical attribute. However, sometimes, there are situations where you want Terraform to replace the resource when another resource is updated or replaced. Often, this can happen when there is no direct dependency between the resources, making it difficult for Terraform to determine that a destructive action is taking place.

For example, with an Azure Virtual Desktop Host Pool, the Host Pool and its Virtual Machines are declared independently. Still, they are associated with a third resource called a Virtual Machine Extension that will initiate the joining of the Virtual Machine with the Host Pool. In this scenario, Terraform knows about the Virtual Machine's Relationship to the VM Extension and the VM Extension's relationship with the Host Pool. Still, because you create the Host Pool's relationship to the Virtual Machine through an attribute in the VM Extension, it does not cause a replacement if it is updated. Therefore, the Virtual Machine will never be reattached to the Host Pool if it changes.
