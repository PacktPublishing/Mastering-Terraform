# 3. Splat Expressions

A Splat Expression is another way of accessing an attribute of each item in a `list` of objects. You can use this expression to access a single attribute from a resource or module block with the `count` or `for_each` meta-argument attached.

```
	resource "aws_instance" "node" {
	
	  count = var.node_count
	
	  # the rest of the configuration
	
	}
```

Consider this collection of AWS EC2 instances. This block uses the `count` meta-argument to create a dynamic number of these resources from 0 to n, where n is the value of `var.node_count`. As a result, we can't just access output values from this resource like we usually would if it were singular. We need to access it using an index to specify which instance of the resource block we want to access.

```
	locals {
	  first_instance_id = aws_instance.node[0].id
	}
```

In this case, we specify the index of 0 and access its `id` attribute. But what if we wanted to get all of the values of `id` for every EC2 instance simultaneously? Using a ' for ' expression, we could iterate over the `list` of `aws_instance` resources. However, there is a better wayâ€”using the Splat Expression.

```
	locals {
	  all_instance_ids = aws_instance.node[*].id
	}
```

Using a `*` instead of an actual numeric index tells Terraform that we want to activate a Splat Expression. Instead of accessing a single object, we want to access all the objects in the array. Once done, the `id` returns a `list` containing all the `id` values for our EC2 instances.
