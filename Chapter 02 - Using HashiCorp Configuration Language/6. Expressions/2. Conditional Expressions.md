# 2. Conditional Expressions

In other languages, this technique is called a ternary conditional operator, namely of the imperative variety. Thatâ€™s fancy talk for an if statement in HCL. Typically, an if block spans multiple lines of code and uses some method for scoping the two conditions.

```
	if (x == 5) {
	  // do something
	} else {
	  // do something else
	}
```

This classic example shows how a conditional statement manifests in an imperative language. The curly brackets provide scope for the code that the computer will execute when the boolean expression is true or false. In imperative code, you can do anything inside these scoped regions. 

The difference between this approach and using a Ternary Conditional Operator is that, with the former, the goal is always to produce a value.

With a Ternary Conditional Operator, each condition must return a value. Consider the following expression:

```
	y = x == 5 ? x * 10 : 0
```

The above expression will set the value of `y` to be fifty (50) when `x` is five (5), and it will set the value to zero (0) for any other value of `x`. The equivalent imperative code would look like this:

```
	int y;
	if (x == 5) {
	  y = x * 10
	} else {
	  y = 0
	}
```

The difference between this imperative alternative and the Ternary Conditional Operator statement is that the developer can do other things in the scope regions that are either related or unrelated to setting the value of `y` appropriately.
