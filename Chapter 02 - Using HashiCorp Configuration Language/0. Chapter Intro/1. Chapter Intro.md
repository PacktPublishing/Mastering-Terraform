# 1. Chapter Intro

In the first chapter, we examined Terraform’s architecture. It is a simple command-line tool that takes in code and creates a plan that it can later execute at the user’s behest. In this chapter, we will examine how to leverage Terraform’s language—HashiCorp Configuration Language, or HCL—to define infrastructure-as-code so that we can build sophisticated cloud-based architectures using Terraform.

*CH2 TR: Including real-world examples showcasing the transition from code to actual cloud infrastructure might make the chapter more engaging and provide tangible context for the concepts discussed. *

*CH2 TR: coverage of common pitfalls or advanced usage scenarios that practitioners frequently encounter, which are not fully addressed. The reader may have questions on best practices for structuring large Terraform codebases or managing states in complex environments.*

*CH2 TR: need concrete examples of their impact on provisioning real-world resources to work on the abstract nature of expressions and functions.*
