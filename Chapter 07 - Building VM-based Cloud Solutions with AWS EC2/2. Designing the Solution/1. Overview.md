# 1. Overview

Due to the tight timelines the team is facing we want to keep the cloud architecture simple. Therefore, we’ll be keeping it simple and using tried and tested services of Amazon AWS to implement the platform as opposed to trying to learn something new. The first decision we have to make is what Amazon AWS service each component of our logical architecture will be hosted on.

Our application architecture consists of three components: a Frontend, a Backend, and a database. The front end and back end are application components and need to be hosted on a cloud service that provides general computing, while the database needs to be hosted on a cloud database service. There are many options for both types of services.

_Logical Architecture for the Autonomous Vehicle Platform_

Since we have decided we’re going to use Virtual Machines to host our application, we have narrowed down the different services that we can use to host our application, and we have decided that AWS Elastic Cloud Compute (EC2) Service is the ideal choice for our current situation. There are other options, such as Elastic Beanstalk, that also use Virtual Machines, but we want to have total control over the solution and maintain as many cross-platform capabilities as possible in case we ever have to migrate to a different cloud platform.

_Source Control structure of our repository_

In this solution we’ll have six parts. We still have the application code and Packer templates for both the front- and back end. Then we have GitHub Actions to implement our CI / CD process and Terraform to provision our AWS infrastructure and reference the Packer-built virtual machine images for our EC2 instances.
