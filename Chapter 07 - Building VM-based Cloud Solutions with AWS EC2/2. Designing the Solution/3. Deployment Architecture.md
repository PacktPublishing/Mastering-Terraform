# 3. Deployment Architecture

Now that we have a good idea of what our Cloud Architecture is going to look like for our solution on AWS, we need to come up with a plan for how to provision our environments and deploy our code.

## Virtual Machine Configuration

In our solution, we have two Virtual Machine roles: the Frontend role, which is responsible for handling web page requests from the end user’s web browser, and the backend, which is responsible for handling REST API requests from the web application. Each of these roles has a different code and different configuration that needs to be set. Each will require its own Packer template to build a Virtual Machine Image that we can use to launch a Virtual Machine on AWS.

_Packer Pipeline to build a Virtual Machine Image for the Frontend_

A GitHub Actions Workflow that triggers off changes to the Frontend Application Code and the Frontend Packer Template will execute Packer `build` and create a new Virtual Machine Image for the solution’s Frontend.

Both the front end and the back end will have identical GitHub workflow that executes Packer `build`. The key difference between the workflows is the code bases that they execute against. Both the front end and the back end might have slightly different Operating System configurations, and both require different deployment packages for their respective application components.

It’s important to note that the application code will be baked into the Virtual Machine Image rather than copied to an already running Virtual Machine. This means that in order to update the software running on the Virtual Machines, each Virtual Machine will need to be restarted so that it can be restarted with a new Virtual Machine Image containing the latest copy of the code.

This approach makes the Virtual Machine Image itself an immutable deployment artifact that is versioned and updated each time there is a release of the application code that needs to be deployed.

## Cloud Environment Configuration

Once the Virtual Machine Images have been built for both the Frontend and the Backend, then we can execute the final workflow that will both provision and deploy our solution to AWS.

_Virtual Machine Images as inputs to the Terraform Code provisions the environment on AWS_

The Terraform codebase will have two input variables for the version of the Virtual Machine Image for both the Frontend and the Backend. When new versions of the application software need to be deployed, the input parameters for these versions will be incremented to reflect the target version for deployment. When the workflow is executed, Terraform `apply` will simply replace the existing Virtual Machines with Virtual Machines using the new Virtual Machine Image.
