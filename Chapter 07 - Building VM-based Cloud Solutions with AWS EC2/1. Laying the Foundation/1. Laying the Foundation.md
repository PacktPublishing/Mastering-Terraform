# Laying the Foundation

Cloud infrastructure is only as good as the applications and services deployed to it, so for this book, we will be building our sample architectures around a function use case for a fictional company called Söze Enterprises. Söze Enterprises was founded by a mysterious Turkish Billionaire, Keyser Söze, who wants to take Autonomous Vehicles to the next level by building a platform that will allow Autonomous Vehicles (both land and air)—from any manufacturers—to coordinate their actions to improve safety and efficiency. Somehow, Keyser has already got Elon onboard, so it’s only a matter of time before the other EV vendors follow suit. 

We have inherited a team from one of Söze Enterprises’ other divisions that has a strong core team of C# .NET developers, so we’ll be building version 1.0 of the platform using .NET technologies. The elusive CEO, Keyser, was seen hobnobbing with Jeff Bezos in Monaco over the weekend, and word has come down from corporate that we will be using Amazon Web Services to host the platform. Since the team doesn’t have a ton of experience with containers and timelines are tight, we’ve decided to build a simple three-tier architecture and host on Virtual Machines using AWS Elastic Cloud Compute (EC2) Service. We’ve decided to use a Linux operating system to make it easier to convert to containers in the future.

_Logical Architecture for the Autonomous Vehicle Platform_

The platform will need a front end, which will be a Web UI built using ASP.NET Core Blazor. The front end will be powered by a REST API back end, which will be built using ASP.NET Core WebAPI. Having our core functionality encapsulated into a REST API will allow Autonomous Vehicles to communicate directly with the platform and allow us to expand by adding client interfaces with additional frontend technologies like native mobile apps and Virtual or Mixed Reality in the future. The backend will use a PostgreSQL Database for persistent storage since it’s lightweight, industry-standard, and relatively inexpensive.
