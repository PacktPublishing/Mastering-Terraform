# 2. Packer

Because the Virtual Machine Image acts as an immutable artifact that contains a versioned copy of the Application Code and Operating System configuration, we need to update this artifact anytime something changes in either the Application Code or the Operating System Configuration.

	on:
	  push:
	    branches: 
	    - main
	    paths:
	    - 'src/packer/frontend/**'
	    - 'src/dotnet/frontend/**'

This means that we need a trigger on both codebases that affect the final artifact for Packer, which includes the Application Code and the Operating System Configuration within the Packer template itself. With GitHub Actions, we can add a list of `paths` that will trigger our Workflow.

We should build a new Virtual Machine Image every time there is a Pull Request and every time there is a Push onto `main`. When Packer is executed, it is essentially doing a pretty rigorous Integration Test. Therefore, it’s useful to have it performed as part of our Continuous Integration process. That means we need to have a Virtual Machine Image that is tested and verified to be production-ready before we push the code into the `main` branch.

_Virtual Machine Image Versioning_

Our Packer Workflow will generate a unique name and version for each Virtual Machine Image it produces. We can build tests into our Packer template to verify that the web server is running and listening on port `5000`. Using this version of the image, we can also launch a new Virtual Machine and inspect the Operating System’s configuration ourselves to make sure everything is in order.

When we are confident that the code changes to either the Application Code or the Operating System Configuration are fully functional, we can approve the Pull Request and merge it into the `main` branch. This will trigger a new version of the Virtual Machine Image from the production-ready code in the `main` branch, and we can use the new version of this production-ready Virtual Machine Image to update our Cloud Environment configuration when we are ready to deploy these changes to our environments.

The GitHub Actions Workflow needs some ground rules to be established that control the specific versions of software and key locations within the codebase. It’s important to always be specific. This means using specific versions of software instead of relying on the internet gods to decide which version you’ll use. This might work well when you are running things locally on your machine, and you are there to solve the inevitable problems and conflicts that arise, but for an automation pipeline, there is no human there to correct things as they are happening; there are only assumptions—assumptions about what version of the software you’re using.

We use two pieces of software: the .NET SDK and Packer. Likewise, we have two codebases: the C# .NET codebase for the application and the HCL codebase for Packer. As such, we should establish where these code bases are very clearly and upfront. Setting pipeline variables for them is a very useful way of accomplishing that, as it ensures they are featured prominently in the YAML file and are stored in a reusable variable in case they will be repeated multiple times.

	env:
	  DOTNET_VERSION: '6.0.401' # The .NET SDK version to use
	  PACKER_VERSION: '1.9.4' # The version of Packer to use
	  WORKING_DIRECTORY: "./src/packer/frontend"
	  DOTNET_WORKING_DIRECTORY: "./src/dotnet/frontend/FleetPortal"

Now that we have the triggers and some variables set for our Workflow, we need to structure the `jobs`. For each Packer template, we will have two jobs: one that builds the C# .NET application code and produces a deployment package and another that runs `packer build` to produce the Virtual Machine Image.

	jobs:
	
	  build:
	    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
	    steps:
	
	      ...
	
	  packer:
	    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
	    steps:
	
	      ...

The `build` job performs a pretty standard .NET build process, which includes restoring package dependencies from Nuget (the .NET package manager), building the code, running Unit and Integration Tests, publishing a deployable artifact, and storing that artifact so that it can be used by future jobs within the pipeline.

_Packer Workflow_

The `packer` job immediately downloads the `zip` file containing the deployment artifact and puts it into a location where the Packer template’s `file` provisioner expects it. Then, it generates a unique version of the name for the Virtual Machine Image that will be produced if successful. 

	- id: image-version
	  name: Generate Version Number
	  run: |
	   echo "version=$(date +'%Y.%m').${{ github.run_number }}" >> "$GITHUB_OUTPUT"

It does this by using Bash to generate the current year and month and appends the `github.run_number` to ensure uniqueness if we happen to be running this pipeline more than once per day.

Next, it obtains the public IP address for the Virtual Machine on which the GitHub Action Workflow is running.

	- id: agent-ipaddress
	  name: Check Path
	  working-directory: ${{ env.WORKING_DIRECTORY }}
	  run: |
	    ipaddress=$(curl -s http://checkip.amazonaws.com)
	    echo $ipaddress
	    echo "ipaddress=$ipaddress" >> "$GITHUB_OUTPUT"

It does this so that when it runs `packer build` it can configure Packer’s plugin for AWS to poke a hole in the firewall to allow SSH traffic from the GitHub Actions machine to the temporary Virtual Machine running on AWS where the Packer provisioners are executed on.

Next, it installs a specific version of Packer.

	- id: setup
	  name: Setup `packer`
	  uses: hashicorp/setup-packer@main
	  with:
	    version: ${{ env.PACKER_VERSION }}

Finally, it executes `packer build` making sure to specify the `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` environment variables that the AWS plugin relies upon to authenticate to AWS’s REST APIs. 

	- id: build
	  name: Packer Build
	  env:
	    AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: ${{ vars.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}
	    AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}
	    PKR_VAR_image_version: ${{ steps.image-version.outputs.version }}
	    PKR_VAR_agent_ipaddress: ${{ steps.agent-ipaddress.outputs.ipaddress }}
	  working-directory: ${{ env.WORKING_DIRECTORY }}
	  run: |
	    packer init ./
	    packer build -var-file=variables.pkrvars.hcl ./

It also specifies two input variables to the Packer template using the `PKR_VAR_` prefixed environment variable technique to include the image version and the Build Agent IP Address that were dynamically generated within the GitHub Actions Workflow itself.
