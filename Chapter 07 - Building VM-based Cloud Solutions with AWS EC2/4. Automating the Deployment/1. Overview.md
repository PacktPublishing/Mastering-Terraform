# 1. Overview

As we discussed in our design, our solution is made up of two Application Components: the front end and the back end. Each has its own codebase of Application Code, and Operating System configuration encapsulated within a Packer template. These two application components are then deployed into a cloud environment on AWS, which is defined within our Terraform codebase.

There is an additional codebase that we have yet to discuss: our automation pipelines. We will be implementing our automation pipelines using GitHub Actions.

_Source Code Structure within GitHub Repository_

In GitHub Actions, automation pipelines are called Workflows and they are stored in a particular folder within the source code repository, namely `/.github/workflows`. Each of our codebases is stored in its own folder. Our solutions source code repository’s folder structure will look like this:

	- .github
		- workflows
	- dotnet
		- backend
		- frontend
	- packer
		- backend
		- frontend
	- terraform

As per our design, we will have GitHub Actions Workflows that will execute Packer and build Virtual Machine images for both the front end (e.g., `packer-frontend.yaml`) and the Backend (e.g., `packer-backend.yaml`). We’ll also have Workflows that will run `terraform plan` and `terraform apply`. 

	- .github
		- workflows
			- packer-backend.yaml
			- packer-frontend.yaml
			- terraform-apply.yaml
			- terraform-plan.yaml

Each folder path will allow us to control which GitHub Actions Workflows should trigger so that we aren’t unnecessarily running Workflows when no applicable changes have been made.

Because we are following GitFlow, we’ll have a main branch where the production version of all of our code will reside. Developers, whether they are working on updates to the Application Code (e.g., the C#), the Operating System Configuration (e.g., the Packer template), or the Cloud Environment Configuration (e.g., the Terraform template), will create a branch off of `main` with the `feature/*` naming convention. 

They can do their development and, when ready, submit a Pull Request. This indicates that the Developer believes their code changes are ready to be merged back into the `main` branch—or, in other words—that their code changes are ready for production!

_GitFlow: Pull Request Process_

The Pull Request is a great time to perform some checks on our solution’s code. For the application Code, this could take the form of a build, static code analysis, and Unit or Integration Tests. Each of these actions tests a different aspect of the application code. The build (i.e., the compilation of the C# codebase) is one of the most basic tests that we can perform. It simply tests whether the application code is valid C# and is devoid of inherent language syntax errors. Static code analysis can cover a wide range of code quality checks, including readability and maintainability or security and vulnerability assessments. The Unit and Integration tests check the functionality of the software components working individually and together to accomplish the underlying business purpose of the software. Executing these tests on a regular basis is known as “Continuous Integration” and is one-half of the famous and often elusive “CI / CD pipeline.”

The Continuous Integration pipeline cuts down on routine work surrounding the built-in quality of the application code. Without it, these checks would need to be performed by humans through exhaustive code reviews and manual testing. We still need to do code reviews and manual testing, but a good continuous integration pipeline will reduce the effort that humans need to perform.

Now that we have covered what built-in quality controls we can put on application code, what can we do with our Operating System and our Cloud Environment Configuration? Is there a way to test Infrastructure-as-Code without provisioning the infrastructure? There is, but there are limitations.
