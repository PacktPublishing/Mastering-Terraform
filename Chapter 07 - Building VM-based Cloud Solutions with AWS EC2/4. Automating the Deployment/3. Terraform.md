# 3. Terraform

With both of our Virtual Machine Images built and their versions input into our `tfvars` file, our Terraform automation pipeline is ready to take the reigns and not only provision our environment but deploy our solution as well (although not technically). The deployment was technically done within the `packer build` process, with the physical deployment packages being copied to the home directory and the Linux service setup primed and ready. Terraform is finishing the job by actually launching Virtual Machines using these images.  

	on:
	  push:
	    branches: 
	    - main
	    paths:
	    - 'src/terraform/**'

This means that we only need to trigger the Terraform automation pipeline when the Terraform codebase changes itself. This could be configuration changes to the resources, or it could simply be an updated Virtual Machine Image version within the `tfvars` file.

_Terraform Apply Workflow_

As a result, the Terraform pipeline is quite simple. We simply need to execute either `terraform plan` or `terraform apply` depending on whether we want to evaluate or execute the changes to our Cloud Environment.

In keeping with the ‘always be specific’ mantra, we dutifully designate the version of Terraform that we want to use and specify the location for the Terraform codebase using pipeline variables.

	env:
	  TERRAFORM_VERSION: '1.5.7'
	  WORKING_DIRECTORY: "./src/terraform"

Next, we install the particular version of Terraform using the `setup-terraform` GitHub Action published by HashiCorp, which will handle the details of its installation for us.

	    - id: setup
	      name: Setup `terraform`
	      uses: hashicorp/setup-terraform@main
	      with:
	        version: ${{ env.TERRAFORM_VERSION }}

Finally, it executes `terraform apply` again, making sure to include the AWS credentials and the target backend location for Terraform State.

	- id: apply
	  name: Terraform Apply
	  env:
	    AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: ${{ vars.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}
	    AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}
	    BACKEND_BUCKET_NAME: ${{ vars.BUCKET_NAME }}
	    BACKEND_REGION: ${{ vars.BUCKET_REGION }}
	  working-directory: ${{ env.WORKING_DIRECTORY }}
	  run: |
	    terraform init \
	      -backend-config='bucket='$BACKEND_BUCKET_NAME \
	      -backend-config='region='$BACKEND_REGION \
	      -backend-config="key=aws-vm-sample"
	
	    terraform apply -target "random_shuffle.az" -auto-approve
	    terraform apply -auto-approve

The backend configuration is set using the `-backend-config` command line arguments, which frees us from having to hardcode these settings in our source code.

Notice that we execute `terraform apply` twice. First, perform a targeted apply on the `random_shuffle.az` resource, and second, a general apply. The targeted apply is to ensure that the Availability Zones we are targeting have been selected before we calculate the IP Address Space for our networks. The need for this is driven by the dynamic nature of the calculation of address space using the `cidrsubnet` function. If we wanted to avoid this targeted apply approach we could opt for a more hard coded approach of the Availability Zones and the corresponding address spaces.

That’s it! With the completion of our Terraform GitHub Actions Workflow, we have put the finishing touches on our end-to-end CI / CD pipeline, and our AWS-based solution will be up and running our Virtual Machine Cloud Architecture in no time.
