# 1. Chapter Intro

Now that we have a good foundation of the concepts needed to build real-world cloud solutions and automate them using Infrastructure-as-code with Terraform, we will start our journey with arguably the most popular cloud platform: Amazon Web Services (AWS). 

In this chapter, we’ll take a step-by-step approach to designing, building, and automating a solution using AWS’s Virtual Machine services—Elastic Cloud Compute or EC2 for short. We’ll also explore several other AWS services crucial for ensuring our solution’s robustness and production readiness, such as secrets management, logging, and network security.

We have much to accomplish, but this is where the rubber hits the road. We’ll begin to really apply the concepts we’ve been discussing and put them into practice on Amazon Web Services.
