# 1. Laying the Foundation

Our team at Söze Enterprises applauds their achievement of responding to the whimsical technical course correction of their fearless leader, Keyser Söze, and marvels at their success and fortune in launching their product successfully on Microsoft Azure. They utilized virtual machines, Kubernetes, and, finally, serverless technology. The comforting deep blue of the Azure Portal begins to fade away when suddenly, the air fills with an eerie yet familiar sound: doodle-oo doodle-oo doodle-oo. The familiar duo appears—sitting in a cozy wood-paneled basement, a look typical of suburban basements from the late 80s and early 90s. The walls are adorned with posters and memorabilia, including a prominent Chicago Bears pennant, highlighting Wayne's love for rock music and sports. They start the familiar chant: doodle-oo doodle-oo doodle-oo. Suddenly, we're transported to another world—another universe, perhaps, where Google Cloud’s sleek multicolored logo replaces Azure’s deep blue. Söze Enterprises has now partnered with Google Cloud for their next-generation Autonomous Vehicle platform.

As before, we inherited a team from one of Söze Enterprises’ other divisions with a strong core team of C# .NET developers, so we’ll build version 1.0 of the platform using .NET technologies. The elusive CEO, Keyser, was rumored to have joined Google co-founder Sergey Brin aboard his super yacht, the Dragonfly, off the Amalfi Coast, and word has come down from corporate that we will be using Google Cloud to host the platform. Since the team doesn’t have much experience with containers and timelines are tight, we’ve decided to build a simple three-tier architecture and host on Azure Virtual Machines.

_Logical Architecture for the Autonomous Vehicle Platform_

The platform will need a front end, which will be a Web UI built using ASP.NET Core Blazor. The front end will be powered by a REST API back end, which will be built using ASP.NET Core WebAPI. Having our core functionality encapsulated into a REST API will allow Autonomous Vehicles to communicate directly with the platform and allow us to expand by adding client interfaces with additional frontend technologies like native mobile apps and Virtual or Mixed Reality in the future. The backend will use a PostgreSQL Database for persistent storage since it’s lightweight, industry-standard, and relatively inexpensive.
