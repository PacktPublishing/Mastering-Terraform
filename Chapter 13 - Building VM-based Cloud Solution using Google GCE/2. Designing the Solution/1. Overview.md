# 1. Overview

Due to the tight timelines the team is facing we want to keep the cloud architecture simple. Therefore, we’ll be keeping it simple and using services of Google Cloud that will allow us to provision using familiar Virtual Machine technologies as opposed to trying to learn something new. The first decision we have to make is what Google Cloud service each component of our logical architecture will be hosted on.

Our application architecture consists of three components: a Frontend, a Backend, and a database. The front end and back end are application components and need to be hosted on a cloud service that provides general computing, while the database needs to be hosted on a cloud database service. There are many options for both types of services.

Since we have decided we’re going to use Virtual Machines to host our application we have narrowed down the different services that we can use to host our application on and we have decided that Google Compute Engine (GCE) Service is the ideal choice for our current situation.

_Source Control structure of our repository_

In this solution we’ll have six parts. We still have the application code and Packer templates for both the front- and back end. Then we have GitHub Actions to implement our CI / CD process and Terraform to provision our Google Cloud infrastructure and reference the Packer-built virtual machine images for our GCE instances.
