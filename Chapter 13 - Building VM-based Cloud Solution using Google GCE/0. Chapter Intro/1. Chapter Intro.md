# 1. Chapter Intro

You made it. After the previous six chapters, where we used two different cloud platforms and three different cloud computing paradigms to build six distinct solutions, we are finally ready to take our final journey by adapting our solution to the Google Cloud Platform.

Like the last two adventures, in this alternate universe, we will be starting our journey by building our solution with Virtual Machine architecture on Google Cloud. As we saw when transitioning between AWS and Azure when we compared how the same solution architecture was built on the two different cloud platforms, some things changed a lot, while many things changed only a tiny bit—or not at all. We observed that our Terraform changed pretty consistently across all chapters. However, other things like Packer, Docker, and GitHub Actions workflows only changed slightly. Our .NET-based Application Code didn’t change at all, whether being hosted in Virtual Machines or Containers, but when we got to serverless, the application code went through radical refactoring. 

The same is true as we move the solution to Google Cloud Platform. As a result, we won’t be revisiting these topics at the same length in this chapter. However, I would encourage you to bookmark Chapter 7 and Chapter 8 and refer to them frequently. This chapter will focus only on the changes we must make to deploy our solution on the Google Cloud Platform.
