# 1. Overview

As we discussed in our design, our solution is made up of two Application Components: the Frontend and the Backend. Each has its own codebase of Application Code and Operating System configuration encapsulated within a Packer template. These two Application Components are then deployed into a Cloud Environment on Azure that is defined within our Terraform codebase.

Just as we did in Chapters 7 and 8 with the AWS and Azure solutions, there is an additional codebase that we have to discuss: our automation pipelines on GitHub Actions.

In Chapter 7, we went over the folder structure for our codebase and where our GitHub Actions fit in so we know that our automation pipelines are actually called Workflows, and they’re stored in `/.github/workflows`.  Each of our codebases is stored in its own respective folder. Our solutions source code repository’s folder structure will look like this:

- .github
	- workflows
	- dotnet
		- backend
		- frontend
	- packer
		- backend
		- frontend
	- terraform

As per our design, we will have GitHub Actions Workflows that will execute Packer and build Virtual Machine images for both the front (e.g., `packer-frontend.yaml`) and the back end (e.g., `packer-backend.yaml`). We’ll also have Workflows that will run `terraform plan` and `terraform apply`. 

- .github
	- workflows
		- packer-backend.yaml
			- packer-frontend.yaml
			- terraform-apply.yaml
			- terraform-plan.yaml

In Chapter 7, we go into greater detail on the GitFlow process and how it interacts with our GitHub Actions Workflows so for now, let’s dig into how these pipelines will differ when targeting the Azure platform.
