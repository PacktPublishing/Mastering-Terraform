# 3. Using Configuration Manager

One popular approach is to leverage Terraform to provision the Virtual Machines required in your solution and rely on the configuration management tool to handle the rest of the configuration on each Virtual Machine from the Operating System.

This approach has the benefit of isolating the responsibility of configuration management entirely to a tool that is fit to handle this task. Some examples of popular tools include Chef or Puppet, which uses agents to apply configuration onto the Virtual Machines—or it could be a tool like Ansible that requires no agent and uses SSH as the primary method to apply configuration. 

Due to Ansible’s heavy reliance on SSH and Windows’ limited support for this remote access method, Ansible has not historically been an ideal candidate for managing Windows-based Virtual Machines in this manner. Tools like Chef and Puppet have seen more robust adoption in enterprise IT environments where Windows Server was the dominant server Operating System. However, this does appear to be changing—with additional support from Ansible and newer versions of Windows making it easier to manage with this approach.
