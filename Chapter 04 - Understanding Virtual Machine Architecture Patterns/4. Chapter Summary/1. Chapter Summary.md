# 1. Chapter Summary

This chapter looked at the core concepts required to understand Virtual Machines across multiple cloud platforms. In this book, we will build an end-to-end solution using Virtual Machine Architecture for each of the three hyperscalers: AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud. The Providers for each will manifest and exercise these concepts slightly differently. The resources will change, but the concepts as they manifest in our architecture will be relatively consistent.

In the next chapter, we will explore the core concepts needed for a new cloud computing paradigm: containers.
