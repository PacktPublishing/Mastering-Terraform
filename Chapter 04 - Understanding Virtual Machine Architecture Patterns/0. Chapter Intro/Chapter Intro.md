# Chapter Intro

This book aims to help you master Terraform, but what does it take to be a true master? Terraform is an Infrastructure-as-Code tool that enables you to describe your cloud architecture using code. Without a solid understanding of the underlying architecture, you can never become a true master of Terraform. Therefore, I’ve included the next few chapters to provide a groundwork of ubiquitous architectural concepts across cloud platforms to lay the foundation for later chapters when we build sophisticated cloud architectures in three distinct cloud computing paradigms: 

1. Virtual Machines
2. Containers
3. Serverless

With these foundations, you will understand the concepts necessary to follow along with the solution architectures we build in later chapters.

In this chapter, we will focus on the key concepts that are critical for understanding, architecting, and automating Virtual Machine-based solutions. First, we will lay a foundation for fundamental networking concepts such as subnets, routing, perimeter-based security, peering, Virtual Private Network (VPN), and Dedicated Network Connections. 

Next, we’ll delve into the basic anatomy of Virtual Machines, including Disks, Network Interfaces, the subtle nuances between Windows and Linux Virtual Machines, and finally, auto-scaling.

Finally, we’ll round it out by discussing how Virtual Machines are provisioned, covering both mutable and immutable infrastructure practices and their corresponding Infrastructure-as-Code practices and tools.
