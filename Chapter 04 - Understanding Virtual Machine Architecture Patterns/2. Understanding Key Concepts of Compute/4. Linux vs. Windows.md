# 4. Linux vs. Windows

Linux and Windows Virtual Machines are identical anatomically when considering Virtual Machine sizes, disks, and NICs. Still, there are a few key differences when provisioning them to be aware of when using Terraform and other tools to manage them.

## Authentication & Remote Access
Windows Virtual Machines usually require an Administrator Username and Password. In contrast, Linux Virtual Machines usually require an SSH key. After the initial setup, you can configure Windows to support SSH access, but password-based credentials are needed initially.

This caveat also manifests in remotely accessing Virtual Machines using Windows and Linux. Windows uses Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), which requires password-based login, while Linux uses SSH, which can support either password or key-based login.

## Configuration Scripts
Windows supports several different types of scripting by default. However, the most common are Batch Scripting, which uses the Windows command-line interpreter (CMD), and PowerShell. While Microsoft initially developed PowerShell specifically for automating administration tasks on Windows, It has added support for it on Linux, although community adoption has not hit critical mass.

While Linux distributions vary, Bash (Bourne Again SHell) is the default for most distributions. There are others—for example, `ksh`, `csh`, and `tsch`—and while their capabilities are similar to Bash, their popularity varies. 

Windows has even joined the party by introducing Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), which, when installed, can execute Bash scripts natively on Windows.
