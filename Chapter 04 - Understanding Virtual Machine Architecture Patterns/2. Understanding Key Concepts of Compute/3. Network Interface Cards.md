# 3. Network Interface Cards

Virtual Machines can attach Network Interface Cards (NICs) that logically represent the physical thing. As with disks, the size of a Virtual Machine can impact the number of NICs you can add and the features you can enable. 

Through NIC configuration, you can either team them together to create higher bandwidth or attach them to different subnets to connect a Virtual Machine to straddle the line between two separate networks.
