# 5. Auto-Scaling

One of the quintessential advantages of leveraging the cloud is the ability to add elasticity to your solutions in scale. That is to increase capacity when there is heavy usage of your application and decrease capacity when your applicationâ€™s use goes down.

Cloud platforms provide mechanisms that make achieving this very easy. Although they may have different names for this capability, the anatomy of the solution remains the same: you give details on the Virtual Machine Image that you want, how large the Virtual Machine should be, any hard range constraints in terms of the number of instances like a minimum and a maximum and finally several parameters to control when and how fast to scale up or scale down.
