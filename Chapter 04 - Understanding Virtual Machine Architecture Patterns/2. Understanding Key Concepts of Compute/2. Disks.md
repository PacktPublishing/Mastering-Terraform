# 2. Disks

Virtual Machines can attach additional data disks to add extra storage. Like the Virtual Machines, the disks can have varying sizes and performance characteristics. Unlike Virtual Machine sizes, which vary using categorical SKUs that indicate a fixed configuration type, disks use a continuous metric for sizing—in gigabytes (GB). 

In addition to the disk size, you can also choose from several different performance classes optimized for different workload scenarios, such as general purpose, throughput optimized, and provisioned IOPS—which seeks to guarantee a reliable level of performance.

The SKU you select influences the number of disks and the class of disks you can attach to your Virtual Machine—with larger Virtual Machines supporting a larger quantity of disks.
