# 7. Service Endpoints

Most cloud platforms provide services that are primarily accessed directly over the internet. In situations where security is paramount, avoiding transmitting data across the internet is essential. Service endpoints are a feature provided by cloud platforms that enable private network communication between virtual networks and specific services within the cloud environment without traversing the public internet.

While this concept and goal exists and remains the same across all cloud providers we cover in this book, it goes by different names, has varying support across each platformâ€™s service offerings, and may have other attachment and routing mechanisms to set them up.
