# 6. Network Peering

Virtual Network peering is a networking feature offered by most cloud platforms that allows you to connect virtual networks within the same cloud environment within the same region or regions.

To create a peering connection between two virtual networks, they must be in the same cloud platform, and there should not be any conflicts within their network address space. This potential quagmire is one reason why it's essential to think through and apply proper governance around allocated network address ranges.

Peering is a capability that eliminates the need for more complex private site-to-site connections using VPN connections and is the preferred method for connecting networks within the cloud together.
