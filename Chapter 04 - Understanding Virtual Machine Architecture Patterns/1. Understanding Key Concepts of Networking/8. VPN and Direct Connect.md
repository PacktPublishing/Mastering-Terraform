# 8. VPN and Direct Connect

When Virtual Network Peering isn’t an option, you can always leverage traditional site-to-site VPN connectivity options to connect networks from your on-premises networks or across cloud providers.

When setting up a VPN connection, most cloud platforms require you to provide a resource representing the source network and destination network configuration. 

The destination network is where you host the entry point for your VPN and where the VPN traffic traverses to gain connectivity to cloud-hosted resources. The source network is where you have devices that need to connect to the destination network. The source network is often on-premise, but it doesn’t have to be. After that, the most common use case is connecting networks on two different cloud platforms.
