# 3. Subnets

Once you have settled on an IP address space for your network, you will be carving it into subnets. Subnets allow you to segment your network for various reasons, including improved security or organizational and operational efficiencies. 

From a security standpoint, subnets are very important to isolate components of your architecture to reduce the blast radius if a problem occurs in one subnet. By creating routing rules to control network traffic between subnets, you can increase security by cutting down the surface area for an attack.

Depending on the cloud platform, subnets might also influence the physical location of resources provisioned within such as Availability Zoneâ€”as is the case on AWS. However, Azure and GCP do not have this limitation, as their subnets can contain resources that span the entire region.
