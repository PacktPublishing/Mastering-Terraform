# 4. Routing

Once you have segmented your Virtual Network using Subnets, itâ€™s crucial to establish the traffic patterns of network traffic using Route Tables. 

Route Tables allow you to direct network traffic to the correct endpoint based on different rules for different types of traffic. For example, there may be a delineation between internet traffic routed to an Internet Gateway or a NAT Gateway. Similar network routing rules can route traffic to on-premise networks through VPN or Direct Connect connections, peered Virtual Networks, Transit Gateways, or Service Endpoints.
