# 9. Section Summary

In this section, we learned the critical concepts of cloud networking you will encounter whenever you provision Virtual Machines, no matter your target cloud platform. There might be some subtle changes on each platform that affect how you'll use each and how they will affect the availability and structure of your architecture, but their function is essentially the same.

Next, we'll look at the critical concepts of Virtual Machines, including basic anatomyâ€”including disks, network interface cards, and the Virtual Machine itself as well as Operating System-specific differences between Windows and Linux and cloud-specific capabilities such as auto-scaling.
