# 5. Section Summary

In this section, we looked at how we can use Terraform to provision resources to Kubernetes and compared and contrasted this approach to the native Kubernetes options using `kubectl`—both imperatively and declaratively using YAML-based manifests. In the next section, we’ll look at the Helm Provider to see if it provides a better alternative to the options we’ve evaluated thus far.
