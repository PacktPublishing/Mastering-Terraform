# 4. Evaluating the Trade-Offs

With this approach, your Kubernetes resources are defined in HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL), and you then use the terraform apply command to create or update those resources as opposed to using `kubectl` either imperatively or declaratively. 

Like the native YAML approach for Kubernetes, this process is also declarative, meaning you describe what you want but leverage Terraform to figure out how to do it. This is similar to how Kubernetes itself works, but you’re using the Terraform provider to generate the plan and do the work.

While it may seem like a great thing to use one language—HCL—to manage other parts of your infrastructure (like cloud resources on AWS or Google Cloud) and use it to manage your Kubernetes resources, however, because most Kubernetes documentation and samples are in YAML—you will be spending a significant amount of time mapping from YAML into HCL. This can make it difficult to learn and effectively manage Kubernetes at scale.

Therefore, it is usually better to let Terraform manage the underlying infrastructure that Kubernetes sits on while managing Kubernetes using its own declarative approach using YAML and `kubectl`. However, if you can overcome the translation from YAML into HCL—or an even better option that we’ll address later, encapsulate your Kubernetes deployments into Helm Charts—then it might be easier to use Terraform’s Kubernetes provider to eliminate the additional integration with `kubectl` commands embedded in bash scripts that you’ll have to do at the end of your `terraform apply`.

There might also be certain Kubernetes resources that are tightly coupled with your cloud platform and the configuration that Terraform manages for you. These might be individual or stand-alone resources that connect a Kubernetes Service Account to a cloud platform identity or a ConfigMap that sources the bulk of its values from Terraform outputs.
