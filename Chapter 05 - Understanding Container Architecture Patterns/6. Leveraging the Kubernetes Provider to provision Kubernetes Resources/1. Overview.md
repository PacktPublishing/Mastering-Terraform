# 1. Overview

The Kubernetes provider for Terraform is a plugin that allows Terraform to manage resources on a Kubernetes cluster. This includes creating, updating, and deleting resources like deployments, services, and pods.

When using the Kubernetes Terraform provider, your infrastructure description is written in HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL) instead of YAML. This is the language used by Terraform to describe infrastructure and service configurations.
