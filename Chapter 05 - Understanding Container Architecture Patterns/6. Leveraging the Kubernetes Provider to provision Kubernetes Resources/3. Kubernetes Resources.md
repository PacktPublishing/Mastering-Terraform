# 3. Kubernetes Resources

When you use the Kubernetes provider for Terraform we get the same declarative model that we get with Kubernetes’ native YAML manifests but we get all the features and capabilities of the HashiCorp Configuration Language. Which allows us to pass input variables, generate dynamic local values and use string interpolation—the works!

However, the downside of all this is that we have to use HashiCorp Configuration Language to define Kubernetes resources. This goes against the grain of the Kubernetes ecosystem as most Kubernetes documentation and practitioners asking and answering questions online will be using YAML. If we can tolerate the translation from YAML into HCL, then it might be worth it to consider using the Kubernetes provider for Terraform.

	resource "kubernetes_deployment" "my_app" {
	  metadata {
	    name = "my-app"
	  }
	
	  spec {
	    replicas = 3
	
	    selector {
	      match_labels = {
	        app = "my-app"
	      }
	    }
	
	    template {
	      metadata {
	        labels = {
	          app = "my-app"
	        }
	      }
	
	      spec {
	        container {
	          image = "my-app:1.0"
	          name  = "my-app"
	
	          port {
	            container_port = 8080
	          }
	        }
	      }
	    }
	  }
	}


Above is an example of HashiCorp Configuration Language equivalent of the Kubernetes YAML that provisions a Kubernetes deployment resources. Notice the prolific use of curly braces which can be rather jarring for somebody who is used to looking at YAML.
