# 1. Overview

As we discussed previously, Kubernetes has a built-in declarative model based on YAML that allows you to provide resources to your cluster. However, as we saw, one of the challenges of using this model is that there is no way to use dynamic values inside your YAML-based specifications. That’s where Helm comes in. In this section, we’ll look at what Helm is exactly, its basic structure, how to use it, and how we can integrate it with our Terraform pipelines or use it directly with the Helm provider for Terraform.
