# 2. What is Helm?

Helm is widely referred to as a package manager for Kubernetes, but I find this definition a bit perplexing as a software developer who is used to working with package managers for software libraries like Maven, Nuget, or NPM or Operating System package managers like apt or Chocolatey. I suppose at some levels, they share a similarity in aggregating multiple components into a single, versioned package and providing a convenient way to pull these packages into other projects for reuse. 

However, I think a big difference and a unique part of Helm’s architecture is the nature of the templating engine. At its core, Helm allows you to create templates containing one or more Kubernetes YAML manifests and allows you to infuse more dynamic customization within your Kubernetes resources, thus making your Kubernetes deployments much more reusable and easier to manage and maintain. These templates are referred to as ‘Charts’ or ‘Helm Charts’.

In many ways, a Helm chart reminds me more of what a Terraform Module is rather than a traditional package management software—whether its `apt` or `nuget`. The similarities abound when comparing a Terraform module with a Helm chart. They both operating within a folder and define a method for taking input variables and producing outputs.

_Terraform Module Inputs, Outputs and Resources_

A Terraform Module encapsulates an aggregation of several Terraform resources (or other modules) defined within `*.tf` files, and the HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL) allows you to implement any number of dynamic configurations using built-in capabilities of the language.

As mentioned, a Helm Chart performs a similar aggregation but with Kubernetes resources that are defined within `*.yaml` files and use Kubernetes YAML-based markup. Helm defines its own templating engine based on Go-templates that offers a wide range of features that allow you to implement a similar level of dynamic configuration that you can achieve with HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL).

As you can see, the basic structure of a Helm chart is quite simple. It is not as simple as a Terraform Module because we have nested folders that preclude users from being able to cleanly nest Helm Charts within each other. Sub-charts need to be created in a special `charts` directory and can be completely encapsulated within this folder or simply reference an existing chart hosted elsewhere. This is similar to how Terraform Modules work in that you can reference a local module or one hosted at any number of remote locations. A subtle difference is how Terraform Modules can be declared in any `*.tf` file, and their definition simply needs to be stored in another local folder or remote location.

The `Chart.yaml` is a special file inside the Helm Chart that acts as the main entry point file that contains key identification metadata and and other dependencies such as other Helm Charts either defined locally or in a remote location.

	apiVersion: v2
	name: my-webapp
	version: 0.1.0
	description: A basic web application Helm chart

The `values.yaml` is a file that defines the input variables for a Helm Chart. This is an example where in HashiCorp Configuration Language we have no restriction on where we put input variables, by convention—and for our own sanity, we put input variables into a `variables.tf` file. In Helm, this convention of isolating input variable declarations in canonized into a well known file that is recognized beyond a simple convention.

	replicaCount: 1
	image:
	  repository: nginx
	  tag: stable
	  pullPolicy: IfNotPresent
	service:
	  type: ClusterIP
	  port: 80
	ingress:
	  enabled: false
	  annotations: {}
	  path: /
	  hosts:
	    - my-webapp.local
	  tls: []

The `templates` folder is where all our YAML-based manifests will go. However, the YAML is a bit different because it will most likely have many dynamic values injected into it using a Go-templating convention `{{` and `}}` to denote symbolic references that Helm will resolve using the Go-templating engine.

	apiVersion: apps/v1
	kind: Deployment
	metadata:
	  name: {{ template "my-webapp.fullname" . }}
	  labels:
	    app: {{ template "my-webapp.name" . }}
	spec:
	  replicas: {{ .Values.replicaCount }}
	  selector:
	    matchLabels:
	      app: {{ template "my-webapp.name" . }}
	  template:
	    metadata:
	      labels:
	        app: {{ template "my-webapp.name" . }}
	    spec:
	      containers:
	        - name: {{ template "my-webapp.name" . }}
	          image: "{{ .Values.image.repository }}:{{ .Values.image.tag }}"
	          imagePullPolicy: {{ .Values.image.pullPolicy }}
	          ports:
	            - containerPort: 80

Helm Charts can then be installed onto a Kubernetes cluster using a different command line tool called `helm`. This tool performs a number of different functions including auto-generate a basic chart structure, package charts for distribution, manage chart repositories and install charts onto the cluster. 

Both `kubectl` and `helm` use the same method to authenticate with a Kubernetes cluster but they are used for different purposes when managing the cluster. Just like `kubectl`, which can apply declarative Kubernetes configuration using the following command:

`kubectl apply -f <file>.yaml`. 

The `helm` command can be used to provision a Helm Chart to a Kubernetes cluster using the following command:

	helm install my-webapp ./my-webapp`

In this regard, Helm could similarly be integrated into a Terraform CI / CD pipeline that first provisions the Cloud Environment using Terraform and the relevant cloud platform provider (e.g., `aws`, `azurerm`, or `googlecloud`) and then use the `helm` command line tool to install Helm Charts onto the Kubernetes Cluster using connection and authentication information provided by the output of the Terraform stage of the pipeline.

In the next section, we’ll look at how the same process could be streamlined using the Helm provider for Terraform, thus replacing the bash scripts executing the `helm` commands imperatively and managing it with Terraform.
