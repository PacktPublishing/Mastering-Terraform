# 4. Continuous Deployment

Kubernetes has a multitude of ways to provision resources. It has both imperative and declarative covered with the `kubectl` command line tool and Kubernetes YAML manifests (which also use the `kubectl` command line tool) respectively. Because this is a book on Terraform, I think it’s clear the approach we would prefer! Yes, declarative! And because Kubernetes also has its own REST API, it’s possible to build a Terraform provider that communicates with it as well. All of these approaches, using `kubectl` either with imperative commands or the YAML manifests or using `terraform` and the `kubernetes` Terraform provider, are all examples of the traditional push model.

# Push Model

The Push Model is when your CI / CD Pipeline is executing the configuration of the Kubernetes environment externally from the cluster. This could be done with any tool. The most common approach is to provision the cloud environment using Terraform as the first step of the CI / CD Pipeline and then execute `kubectl` commands either just plain old `bash` or YAML manifest files using `kubectl apply -f foo.yaml`.

In this case, the cloud environment is defined in HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL), which is executed as part of the first stage of the pipeline, and then Kubernetes Cluster Configuration is output from this Terraform process to the next stage of the pipeline where `kubectl` is executed to create deployments on the newly created or existing Kubernetes cluster. The Kubernetes Cluster’s existence will depend on whether it was the first time `terraform apply` was executed or not.

The next method is to use Terraform for both of these stages, replacing the `kubectl` stage with a second Terraform stage, this time using a second Terraform root module that only uses the Kubernetes provider for Terraform. The Terraform root module that provisioned the cloud environment stays in its own folder and is completely isolated from this second Terraform codebase.

The first Terraform stage still uses our target cloud platform’s Terraform provider to provision the Kubernetes cluster and other required resources within our Cloud Environment. Likewise, the CI / CD Pipeline still passes the Kubernetes Cluster Configuration that is output from this first Terraform stage to the second Terraform stage where we provision Kubernetes resources to our Kubernetes cluster using the Kubernetes provider for Terraform.

# Pull Model

An alternative to the Push Model is the Pull Model which flips things upside down. Instead of the Kubernetes Resources being provisioned by some actor outside of the Kubernetes cluster itself, the CI / CD pipeline installs a Continuous Deployment service on the cluster and this service connects to a specified source code repository containing Kubernetes YAML manifests and provisions the resources on the Kubernetes cluster.

This approach takes advantage of the immutable and declarative aspects of YAML-based Kubernetes deployments and creates a single source of truth for a Kubernetes deployment within a Git source code repository. As a result, this approach has become more and more identified as a best practice when it comes to fully embracing GitOps, which we’ll delve into more detail in the next chapter.
