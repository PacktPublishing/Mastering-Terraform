# 1. Chapter Intro

In the last chapter, we familiarized ourselves with Virtual Machine architecture and the core concepts and mechanics needed to automate Virtual Machine-based solutions. In this book, we will build end-to-end solutions covering the three significant hyperscalarsâ€”AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud, and covering three cloud computing paradigms: Virtual Machines, Containers, and Serverless. In this chapter, we will look at the core concepts needed to tackle the Container-based Architecture solutions using the managed-Kubernetes offerings from each cloud platform.

To accomplish this, we must understand the basics of containers, Kubernetes, and how they fit within the Terraform ecosystem. Like with Virtual Machines and the surrounding toolchains used for configuration management and the Build vs. Bake dilemma, with Container-based Architecture, we need to make some decisions about where the boundary between Terraform and other tools will exist and how best to integrate configuration management of our containers and container orchestrators with the cloud infrastructure that we provision to host them.
