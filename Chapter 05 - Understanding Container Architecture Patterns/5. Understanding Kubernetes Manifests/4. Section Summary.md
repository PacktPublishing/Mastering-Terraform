# 4. Section Summary

In this section, we looked at how Kubernetes handles deployments natively—both using its own command line utility `kubectl` and its own YAML-based deployment manifests, which allow us to describe Kubernetes resources we want to provision in a declarative way—similar to what Terraform allows us to do with the underlying cloud infrastructure. In the next section, we’ll look at the Kubernetes provider, which gives us a way of managing Kubernetes natively using Terraform.
