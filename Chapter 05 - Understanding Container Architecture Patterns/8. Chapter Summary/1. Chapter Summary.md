# 1. Chapter Summary

In this chapter, we learned the basic concepts needed to understand Containers, Container Orchestrators, and the ways you can provision and manage container-based infrastructure using both Kubernetes native tooling via `kubectl` and `helm` as well as the corresponding Terraform Providers for both Kubernetes and Helm.

This is the end of the cross-platform, cloud agnostic knowledge that we need to build both Virtual Machine and Container-based Architectures across all three hyper scalars. Since Serverless is inherently platform specific and offer significant abstraction from the underlying infrastructure, I will cover each hyper scalarâ€™s offering in its respective chapter.

In the next chapter, we will move beyond cloud architecture paradigms and spend some time understanding how teams deliver infrastructure-as-code solutions using CI / CD pipelines that fuse the infrastructure provisioning, configuration management, and application deployment processes into a cohesive, end-to-end workflow.
