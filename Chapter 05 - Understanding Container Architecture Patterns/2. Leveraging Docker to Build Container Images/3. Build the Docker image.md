# 3. Build the Docker Image

Just like Terraform, Docker uses the current working directory to derive its context. Therefore, when building a docker image, you need to execute the `docker build` command from the same directory where your `Dockerfile` resides. However, you can override this by specifying a different path.

	docker build -t your-image-name .

The `-t` flag lets you tag your image with a memorable name. The `.` may seem out of place, but it tells Docker to look for the `Dockerfile` in the current directory.

After the build completes, you can see your image listed by running:

	docker images
