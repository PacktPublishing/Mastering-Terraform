# 4. Run Docker Images

Docker images are like the Virtual Machine images we built using Packer, which represents a Virtual Machine we have yet to start. They have potential energy but need to be launched as the Operating System disk of a Virtual Machine to achieve kinetic energy and become a running Virtual Machine. Docker images are the same for containers. We need to start a container using the image and specify the runtime configuration.

	docker run -p 4000:80 your-image-name

In this case, because we exposed port 80 in the container, we need to map a port to the container's port 80. The `-p` flag maps a network port inside the container to a port on the host machine. This setting will route traffic from port 4000 on the host to port 80 on the container.

You can run as many containers as your host machine can handle. You are constrained only by the technical resources of the host machine. Sometimes, the cloud platform imposes constraints depending on what SKU of Virtual Machine your host machine is running.

To see which containers are running, you can execute the following Docker command:

	docker ps

This section should help you understand the basic principles of working with Docker images. While there are many more commands and flags you can use with Docker to manage your images and containers, this is out of the scope of this book. I'm providing you with enough theory and practice to be productive in building container-based architectures using Terraform.
