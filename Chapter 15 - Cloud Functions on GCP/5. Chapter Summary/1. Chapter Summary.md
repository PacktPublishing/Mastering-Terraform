# 1. Chapter Summary

In this chapter, we designed, built, and automated the deployment of a complete end-to-end solution using serverless architecture using Google Cloud Functions. To accomplish this, we finally had to make some major changes to our application code to conform to the requirements of the serverless runtime. When adopting serverless offerings, one must make this distinct and considerable decision, as it tightly couples your application code with the target cloud platform.

As we conclude this chapter and this Google Cloud-centric narrative, we have successfully implemented cloud architectures on three different cloud platforms—Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform. 

Throughout our journey with our enigmatic CEO, Keyser Soze, we saw many similarities that cross from one cloud platform to another, but we also saw distinct differences between the cloud platforms, spanning from small naming convention differences, design and implementation variations up to large structural changes within the entire taxonomy of the cloud platforms. In addition to exploring these three cloud platforms, we witness the journey that many organizations face when navigating their journey to the cloud—whether to stick with what they know or to leap into new capabilities and service offerings that pose challenges due to the learning curve but also grant potential opportunities to streamline operations and better take advantage of the economies of scale that the public cloud has to offer.

In the next chapter, we’ll switch gears and look at the distinct challenges when we aren’t starting from scratch but trying to adapt existing environments and architectures to bring them into an infrastructure-as-code world.
