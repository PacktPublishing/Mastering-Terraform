# 2. Terraform

The first thing that we need to do is to provision our environment to Google Cloud. This is going to be extremely similar to the way we did this in the previous chapters. In Chapter 13 we needed to ensure that our Virtual Machine images were built and available before we executed Terraform because the Terraform codebase referenced the Virtual Machine images when it provisioned the Virtual Machines.  This means that with our Virtual Machine architecture, application deployment happens before Terraform provisions the environment.

_Packer-produced Virtual Machine images are a pre-requisite for Terraform_

In Chapter 14, we provisioned our Kubernetes cluster using Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) without such a pre-requisite. In fact, the application deployment occurred after the Kubernetes cluster was online. This means that with Container-based architecture, application deployment happens after Terraform provisions the environment.

_Docker produced Container images are provisioned to Kubernetes after Terraform executes_

When using Google Cloud’s serverless offerings, the deployment process is split. While both the front end and back end of our application need a deployment package to be created, the way they are deployed is different. For the front end, like on other platforms, we simply generate the static web content. However, for the Backend, due to Google Cloud Functions’ unique approach to packaging and deployment, we need to generate a zip archive with the application’s source code itself. These artifacts share a similar purpose to Docker images in that they are a target service-compatible way of packaging our application for deployment.

_The zip archive with the source code acts as the deployment artifacts that are provisioned to Google Cloud when Terraform executes_

As you can see, the Backend deployment looks very similar to the approach used with the Virtual Machine-based architecture. The Terraform code references the packaged artifact and is responsible for deploying it to the Google Cloud Function that it provisions.
