# 1. Laying the Foundation

Our skilled team had just finished putting the finishing touches on the last ConfigMap in our Kubernetes configuration when they received a not-so-surprising telephone call. Keyser seems to have had yet another epiphany, this time while hanging out with Larry Page.

While walking through Larry’s private terminal at San Jose International Airport to his personal Boeing 767 waiting for them, Keyser and Larry were discussing Keyser’s new venture. Larry mentioned in passing, “Keyser, why are you even investing in infrastructure? These days, everybody is going serverless. Focus on your platform. Let Google Cloud focus on how to scale it.”

“Eureka!” Exclaimed Keyser as he tossed a few warm cashews into his mouth before elaborating. “Oh man, Larry, you’re so right! I need to get my team on this right away! What was I thinking? We don’t have time for the plumbing; we need to move fast to stay ahead of the competition!” 

Back at headquarters, the team is adapting to this exciting yet sudden change in direction. Now, thanks to Keyser's bold new strategy, they’re gearing up to dive deep into serverless computing. This shift will require more than just repackaging the application—they’ll have to completely refactor the code!
