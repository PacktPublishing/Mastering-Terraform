# 3. Application Code

Google Cloud Functions are inherently event-based. Each Cloud Function is triggered by a different type of event from a wide variety of Google Cloud services. For the purposes of this book, we’ll focus on the HTTP Trigger only, but if you are interested, I’d recommend you go check out all the other options that Google Cloud Functions has—it’s quite extensive.

_ASP.NET MVC Controller Class Anatomy_

In a traditional ASP.NET REST API solution, you have Controller Classes that embody a specific route and then methods that implement different operations at that route. The Controller Class needs to be decorated with an `ApiController` attribute informing the ASP.NET runtime that this class should be used to process incoming web requests at the route specified in the `Route` attribute.

Each method is decorated with an attribute that denotes which HTTP Verb the method should respond to. In the above example, we use `HttpGet`, but there are corresponding attributes for each of the supported HTTP Verbs. The method can take strongly typed parameters that can either be part of the route, the Query String, or the request body. The method returns an `IActionResult` by default, which allows us to return different data structures depending on the outcome of the request.

In order to implement a REST API using Azure Functions we need to implement a class using the Azure Function SDK. This requires us to slightly adjust how we implement both our class and our method. We will employ different class and method attributes in order to achieve a similar outcome: defining an endpoint that responds to web requests at a specific route.

_Google Cloud Function Class Anatomy_

Google Cloud Functions has a very simple method for integrating with the underlying cloud service that drives the runtime. The only requirement is to implement the `IHttpFunction` interface. This interface has a single requirement to implement a method called `HandleAsync` that takes an `HttpContext` object as its only parameter. There is no return object. Therefore, the only way we have to respond to the client is by writing to the response object that is accessible from the `HttpContext` object.

As we can see, the Cloud Architecture radically simplifies, but one trade-off is that our backend code needs to be adapted to the Google Cloud Functions framework. This will require development and testing efforts in order to transform our codebase into this new hosting model. This stands in stark contrast to what we explored in previous chapters, where we hosted on Virtual Machines or containerized and hosted on a Kubernetes cluster. While conforming to the Google Cloud Functions model does take work, its benefits are two-fold: first, it allows us to take advantage of close to zero sunk cost, and second, it allows us to fully abstract the underlying infrastructure from us and let Google Cloud platform take care of scalability and high availability. This allows us to focus more on the functionality of our solutions rather than the plumbing required to keep the lights on.
