# 1. Chapter Intro

We are almost there! In this chapter, we will build our last solution of the nine we'll build in this book. We are about to close the door on Google Cloud—but only after we take the final step of transitioning our application to serverless architecture as we did on AWS and Azure.  In the last two chapters, we worked hard to implement our solution on Google Cloud using virtual machines and then containers.

We’ve taken time to do some comparisons between how things work across all three cloud platforms to help us understand the subtle and sometimes not-so-subtle differences between them.

We’ve noticed that while our Terraform code has been changing pretty consistently between cloud platforms, our application code and the Operating System configuration—either in Packer or Docker haven’t. As we take our final step with Google Cloud, we’ll be going through a similar process we went through when we transitioned our application to AWS Lambda and Azure Functions. We’ll have to completely refactor the application code.
