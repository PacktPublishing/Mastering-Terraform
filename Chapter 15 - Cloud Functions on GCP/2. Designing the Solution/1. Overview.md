# 1. Overview

In this section, we will look at the overall design of our solution given the shift from virtual machine- and container-based architectures towards serverless architectures. As we saw in previous transformations, Serverless has at its core a quintessential objective of eliminating heavy infrastructure from the stack. Therefore, we will be looking for ways to shed any Google Cloud services that require significant fixed costs, like Virtual Machines or Kubernetes Clusters, and replace them with serverless options. This change in our operational context and our technology landscape will likely require us to rethink some things about our solution, both in its design, implementation, and deployment strategy.

_Logical Architecture for the Autonomous Vehicle Platform_

Our application’s architecture doesn’t change significantly, but we will be using different Google Cloud Services to host it. In this case, we’ll be using Google Cloud Storage to host the Application’s frontend, and we’ll be using Google Cloud Functions to host the Application’s backend.

_Source Control structure of our repository_

In this solution we’ll have four parts of our codebase: Terraform code that provisions the environment, the GitHub Actions code that executes the deployment process. Then we have the two codebases for our application’s frontend and backend.
