# 2. Cloud Architecture

In Chapter 13, our cloud-hosting solution was a set of dedicated Virtual Machines, and in Chapter 14, it was a set of shared Virtual Machines within our Kubernetes cluster’s node pool. Using virtual machines has the most sunk cost, whether they are standalone VMs or part of a Kubernetes node pool. 

In Chapter 14, our entire solution was executed on containers that allowed the front end and the back end to coexist as a set of containers on the same Virtual Machines. This saved some money, but we still needed servers to host the workload. In this chapter, we have a new objective: take advantage of the power of the cloud by leveraging cloud-native services that abstract the underlying infrastructure from us and allow us to truly pay for only what we use. Google Cloud’s serverless offerings will be crucial to us in this endeavor.

## Frontend
In previous chapters we hosted our Frontend on public facing servers that return the HTML and JavaScript that composed our web application and we still required a cloud-hosted solution to host the files and respond to requests. 

However, due to the nature of the web application running within the end user’s browser we really don't need to use cloud-hosted Virtual Machines to host what are essentially flat files. We can use simple cloud storage to host the frontend as a static web site and rely on the cloud platform to shoulder the burden of returning the web content. 

We can use the Google Cloud Storage service on Google Cloud. This service allows us to host static web content that is internet accessible. As we did on AWS and Azure in previous chapters, most of this functionality is achieved by adding a Storage Bucket and enabling it to host web content. However, unlike how we handled this on AWS and Azure, we need to add our own load balancer to ensure our web application functions properly.

As we saw on other platforms, we will gain a huge advantage because Google Cloud Storage has absolutely no sunk costs. When you create an Google Cloud Storage Bucket it costs you absolutely zero dollars ($0) per month. Like other serverless offerings, it uses a set of micro-transactions to measure your activity and charge you for precisely what you use. In Google Cloud Storage this can be a bit complicated as there are several measurements that incur costs.

| Metric             | Unit         | Scale | Price   |
| ------------------ | ------------ | ----- | ------- |
| Storage            | GBs          | 1,000 | $0.023  |
| Write Transactions | Transactions | 1,000 | $0.01   |
| Read Transactions  | Transactions | 1,000 | $0.0004 |

The table above shows all the costs you will run into when using Google Cloud Storage to host your static websites. The prices listed are at time of writing for Google Cloud’s West US 2 region, prices may have changed by the time you are reading this so its best to check the latest prices for the most accurate cost estimation. 

I included these prices to make a point. We can host a static website on a three-node Kubernetes cluster for approximately $300 a month, or we can host a static website on Google Cloud Storage for less than $0.01 a month on the most rock-solid storage tier that Google Cloud has to offer. Which approach would you choose?

## Backend
Like our Frontend, in previous chapters, our Backend was also hosted on Virtual Machines in two different ways: dedicated Virtual Machines and shared Virtual Machines within the node pool on our Kubernetes cluster.

Unlike the front end, our back end doesn't have the option of running entirely client-side inside the end user's web browser. In the Backend, we have custom code that needs to run on a server. Therefore, we need to find a solution to host these components without all the overhead of a fleet of Virtual Machines.
On Google Cloud we can use Google Cloud Functions to accomplish this. Google Cloud Functions is a managed service that allows you to deploy your code without paying the sunk costs for any of the underlying Virtual Machines. Like Google Cloud Storage, it has its own micro-transactional pricing model that charges you for precisely what you use.

| Metric           | Unit         | Scale     | Price      |
| ---------------- | ------------ | --------- | ---------- |
| Compute          | GHz/s        | 1         | $0.00001   |
| Memory           | GB/s         | 1         | $0.0000025 |
| Total Executions | Transactions | 1,000,000 | $0.40      |

The above table shows the costs that you will incur when deploying your code to Google Cloud Functions. The first thing that you'll probably notice is that, like Google Cloud Storage, these prices are extremely small but that they measure a very small amount of activity on the platform.

For example, the Compute and Memory metrics have units that correspond to that resource’s unit of measure per second. For compute, it’s measured in GHz per second, and for memory, it’s measured in GB per second. These units of measure give you the flexibility to adjust the amount of compute and memory resources your Cloud Functions have access to when they are executed. Given that it measures at a 'per second' interval, you don't have to be running your Google Cloud Functions very long to rack up quite a few of these.

_Google Cloud Functions run the application code which is deployed to Google Cloud Storage_ 

Previously, our ASP.NET REST API was set up using a traditional ASP.NET project that used Controllers to implement the REST API endpoints. However, when transitioning to Google Cloud Functions, this solution structure is incompatible with the Cloud Functions framework. In order to be able to host our REST API as Google Cloud Functions, we need to conform to the framework that Cloud Functions dictates. This means that the ASP.NET controller classes will need to be refactored in order to conform to this standard. In the next section, we’ll delve into the code that makes this possible.
