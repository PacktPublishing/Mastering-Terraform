# 3. Deployment Architecture

Now that we have a good idea of what our Cloud Architecture for our solution on Google Cloud will look like, we need to devise a plan for provisioning our environments and deploying our code.

In Chapter 12, when we deployed our application to Virtual Machines, we baked our compiled Application Code into a Virtual Machine image using Packer.

Similarly, in Chapter 13, when we deployed our application to containers on our Kubernetes cluster, we baked our Application Code into container images using Docker.

With serverless, this completely changes because Google Cloud’s serverless offerings completely abstract away the Operating System. This means that all we are responsible for is producing a compatible deployment package.

## Creating the Deployment Package

As discussed in the previous section, we have two components of our application: the front end and the back end. Each has a different deployment target. For the front end, we are going to be deploying as a static website, while the back end is going to be deployed as a Google Cloud Function. Since both are .NET projects, we will be using both .NET and Google Cloud platform-specific tools in order to create deployment packages and deploy them to their target Google Cloud services. The diagram below shows the process we go through to provision our environment, package our application code, and deploy it to the target environment out in Google Cloud.

For the front end, this means enabling the feature to deploy our ASP.NET Blazor web application as a Web Assembly. This will allow the front end to be hosted as a static website that can run completely client-side without any server-side rendering. This is only possible because of the way we have designed our front-end web application, which uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to interact with server-side REST APIs. It's important to note that ASP.NET Blazor supports both hosting options, but we specifically chose to go down the client-side-only path and eliminate any dependency on server-side page rendering. As a result, when we use the .NET CLI to publish our ASP.NET Blazor project, it will emit a folder containing static web content. Then, using a Google Cloud CLI, we can upload the contents of this folder to our Google Cloud Storage Bucket to complete the deployment.

For the Backend, unlike on AWS and Azure, with Google Cloud, the application code shouldn’t be compiled as it needs to be processed by the Cloud Function. This means the actual source code files need to be uploaded as opposed to the compiled artifacts, as we have done previously. Therefore, we must zip the source code folder into a zip archive. Another major difference is that the Terraform provider for Google Cloud requires this zip archive to be uploaded by Terraform.

_GitFlow process to create new versioned artifacts_

This process will integrate nicely with the GitFlow process discussed in Chapter 6. With each new feature we develop, we'll open a new feature branch, and when we’re ready to integrate our updates with the main body of work, we'll submit a Pull Request.

This Pull Request will trigger GitHub Actions that run built-in quality checks on our application code and run a `terraform plan` to evaluate the impact on our long-lived environments. We can do any number of tests before the code is merged, which is good to verify that our updates--both to the application code and to the infrastructure code won't negatively impact our target environment. Once our Pull Request is approved and merged, it will trigger additional GitHub Actions that will apply the changes to the target environment.
