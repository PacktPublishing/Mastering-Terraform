# APPLY

Terraform `apply` is the most crucial operation in the arsenal. Before execution, this command requires `terraform init` to have been executed successfully. Selecting the correct workspace corresponding to the input parameters you specify will also be essential.

Terraform `apply` is also unique compared to other operations: You can execute it by pointing at a single file rather than a working directory. The `terraform plan` command outputs the plan file. If a plan file is not specified, `terraform apply` will execute a plan before the `apply` stage.

It is best practice to execute `apply` by always passing in a plan file. Doing so will ensure that you donâ€™t have any surprises when you execute. However, there is still a chance that something changed in the environment between when you last ran the `plan` and when you finally executed `apply`. 

This is particularly important when working on a team of multiple people that might be introducing change to the environment, either using Terraform locally or a CI/CD pipeline. Changes could also be introduced outside of Terraform through manual changes within the Cloud platform's management portal. By using a Terraform Plan File when you run Terraform Apply, it will help keep the plan you execute exactly what you intended with the best information available at the time of provisioning.

Like `plan`, input variables can set their values in many ways.
