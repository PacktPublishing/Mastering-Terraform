# VALIDATE

Terraform `validate` is a helpful method that is essentially the closest thing to a compiler. It analyzes all the code files within the scope and verifies references and syntax. If there are any broken references to data sources or resources, running this command will help you find them without having to initialize your backend. As a result, the `validate` command is a helpful command to execute as an early warning to detect any problems with your code before you move on to other steps.
