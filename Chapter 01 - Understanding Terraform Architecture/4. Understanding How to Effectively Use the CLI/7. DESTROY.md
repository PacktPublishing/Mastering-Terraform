# DESTROY

Terraform `destroy` is how you can completely eradicate your entire environment. The ability to do so is advantageous when your solution spans multiple logical groups within the target platform or when using multiple providers.

## Logical Container Deletion
Some platforms make it easy to manage the lifecycle of related resources. For example, Microsoft Azure resources every resource to be provisioned within a ‘Resource Group,’ and on Google Cloud Platform, every resource is provisioned within the context of a ‘Project.’ The Azure Resource Group and Google Cloud Project are logical containers you can use to clean up after yourself quickly with a cascading delete operation. Platforms that lack this feature can make it extremely tedious to clean up after yourself such as in AWS, where you must navigate to many different portal pages to ensure you delete everything. Savvy command-line power users can string together their clean-up scripts using a well-planned tagging scheme. Still, tools like Terraform add a lot of value in just being able to delete every resource you provisioned with a single command.

## Cross Platform Deletion
Even on cloud platforms with logical containers to collectively manage the lifecycle of related resources, you still need help with associated resources that you provision in tangential systems or platforms.
