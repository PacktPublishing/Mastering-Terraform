# 1. Chapter Summary

In this chapter, we took an in-depth look at Terraform’s architecture. We primarily focused on two critical architectural components: State and Modularity. Having a sound understanding of Terraform’s architecture is vital for you to be able to use Terraform to its fullest effectively. Finally, we ended by looking at Terraform’s command line interface, which will enable you to, when you’re ready, integrate Terraform with your own CI / CD pipelines. In the next chapter, we will explore the HashiCorp Configuration Language so that we can lay the foundation on which we can start building Infrastructure-as-Code using Terraform.
