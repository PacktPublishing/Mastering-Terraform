# 2. The State File

Terraform State is a JSON data file stored somewhere that Terraform knows how to find. This file maintains a list of resources. Each resource has a resource type identifier and all the configurations for that resource. 

The state file mirrors what we describe in our code but is much more verbose than what we declare in our code. The code below generates a random string with a length of four characters, no upper-case characters, and no special-case characters.

```
	resource "random_string" "foo" {
	  length  = 4
	  upper   = false
	  special = false
	}
```

After running `terraform apply`, Terraform will produce a state file containing the same resource but with more context.

```
	{
	  "mode": "managed",
	  "type": "random_string",
	  "name": "foo",
	  "provider": "provider[\"registry.terraform.io/hashicorp/random\"]",
	  "instances": [
	    {
	      "schema_version": 2,
	      "attributes": {
	        "id": "vyoi",
	        "keepers": null,
	        "length": 4,
	        "lower": true,
	        "min_lower": 0,
	        "min_numeric": 0,
	        "min_special": 0,
	        "min_upper": 0,
	        "number": true,
	        "numeric": true,
	        "override_special": null,
	        "result": "vyoi",
	        "special": false,
	        "upper": false
	      },
	      "sensitive_attributes": []
	    }
	  ]
	}
```

The `provider` and `type` help identify which Resource Type this resource is and which Terraform Providers the developer uses.

The `schema_version` of the resource attribute helps identify whether the current resource is compatible with the current version of the provider. If it is not, it can help give the provider an indicator of how to upgrade it to the latest version of the schema.
