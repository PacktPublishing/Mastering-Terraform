# 1. Terraform State

Terraform uses the State to remember what was previously provisioned in a given Workspace. Some critics of Terraform, when they compare it to AWS CloudFormation or Azure Resource Management Templates, point out that these technologies don't rely on this concept of maintaining State in an externalized file. Of course, this is only true because these tools only support a single target platform and can tightly couple to the proprietary nature in which those platforms maintain state. However, Terraform—with its flexible plugin architecture—can't assume anything about the platform and the resources that it provisions to each target platform. Therefore, Terraform needs to drop to the lowest common denominator and ensure that it knows what it has provisioned before in a uniform and consistent fashion.

This approach to maintaining the State provides a couple of benefits. First, it uniformly records what Terraform has provisioned across platforms that maintain their internal State and those that don't. Second, it allows Terraform to define a boundary between managed and unmanaged resources. 

This problem is the classic 'Jurassic Park problem.' In Jurassic Park, they had genetically engineered all these dinosaurs. They engineered them with population control in mind—so they couldn't mate—or so they thought. In the park, they had all these sophisticated systems to track where all the dinosaurs were and how many of them there were. However, the big flaw of their design was that they programmed their systems to only look for the dinosaurs that they genetically engineered. So their system worked flawlessly and showed them where all the dinosaurs they created were. Wouldn’t you know it? The number of dinosaurs always matched the number they expected to see. That's bad for Jurassic Park because, due to this flaw, they were unaware of a defect in their genetic engineering that allowed the dinosaurs to mate. Jurassic Park had too many dinosaurs, and things got—well—a little out of hand.

Terraform only looks for resources that it has provisioned. It can do that because it maintains a state file. The state file is just like the list of dinosaurs that Jurassic Park thinks it has. This approach was terrible for Jurassic Park. But for Terraform, it's a good thing.

Why? Because not all resources are going to be—or need to be created and managed by Terraform. By clearly scoping what Terraform is responsible for (and what it's not), it allows Terraform to be flexible in allowing organizations to choose their level of involvement with Terraform. Some teams and organizations will start small and only deploy a few things with Terraform. At the same time, others might go nuts and provision everything with Terraform. Even still, there will very likely be things that are happening that Terraform doesn't know about. The Terraform State is constructing guard rails to keep Terraform in its box and let it know what it's allowed to touch. Doing so enables Terraform to play well with others and gives freedom to teams and individuals to use whatever method or tools they want to control aspects of an environment.
