# 3. Partial Resource Management

Due to Terraform’s nature as a piece of open source software and the built-in assumption that these cloud providers are their own piece of software that is evolving over time, at a different pace than the Terraform providers, there will be periods of time where the cloud providers will have features that Terraform is unaware of. 

When this happens, we don’t want Terraform to fight with the cloud provider to turn them off just because Terraform isn’t aware of them. This scenario is extremely common as it presents itself naturally when an environment is being managed by Terraform and a specific version of the Terraform provider. As the Terraform provider has new features added to keep pace with the target cloud platform, the provider version is not always kept up-to-date in the Terraform code—nor should it have to.

Let’s say we provide an environment using Terraform and v1.0, our favorite cloud platform’s Terraform provider. The next day, our favorite cloud provider added this amazing feature, Feature X. We still have the same code and the same Terraform state file, but we are extremely eager to try out Feature X. However, we are using the latest version of the Terraform provider—v1.0—and it has no support for Feature X. 

What can we do? Well, we can wait for our friendly internet strangers who contribute to the Terraform provider’s open-source project to add support for Feature X. However, we don’t know when that will be. 

Did we mention we were extremely eager to try out Feature X? If we just can’t wait, we could just enable Feature X directly on our favorite cloud platform. ‘Wouldn’t this create drift,’ you say? Under normal circumstances—yes—as we’re modifying our Terraform-managed resource using our favorite cloud platform web interface. Normally, the next time we run `terraform apply,` Terraform will detect that changes have been made to that resource outside the environment and revert our changes. However, since we are on v1.0 of the Terraform provider, Terraform is happily ignorant of Feature X. Thus, any changes we make to the configuration of Feature X will go unnoticed by Terraform. This also means that if you delete that resource `terraform destroy` and re-create it, you’d have to go out to the portal and manually reconfigure Feature X all over again. 

That is until we upgraded to v1.1 of the Terraform provider, which was released the day after we manually set up Feature X on our resource. Now that we are using v1.1 of the Terraform provider, the resource Terraform is using to provision that service to our favorite cloud platform is now aware of Feature X. If our code is still the same, it’s going to think that Feature X shouldn’t be enabled at all and should remove it.

To avoid this, we’ll need to carefully run `terraform plan` with the v1.1 of the Terraform provider to see what changes Terraform is planning using this upgraded version of the provider. Then, we’ll need to update our code to configure Feature X just as it is configured. Once we do that, Terraform will see that no changes are required, and Terraform will bring Feature X under management.
