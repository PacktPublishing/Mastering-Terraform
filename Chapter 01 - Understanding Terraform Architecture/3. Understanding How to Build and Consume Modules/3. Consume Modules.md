# 3. Consume Modules

Now, we understand the design considerations for when and how to design sound modules. Let's look at how we can consume and manage modules, from small Scenario-Driven Modules to strongly versioned Framework Modules.

## Local Modules

Local modules can maximize code reuse within your Terraform solutions without incurring the overhead of setting up and maintaining a separate module repository.

Using local modules for application-specific patterns, such as components or layers within your architecture, can be a great way to organize your Terraform code. One typical pattern when deploying to the cloud is active-active, multi-region deployments. In this situation, you should design the module to provision the application to a single region, and then this module should be deployed to a configurable set of regions using the `count` or `for_each` meta-argument.

With this approach, you can create load-balancing resources in the root module to distribute traffic across the regional endpoints, coupled with multiple instances of the regional deployment module in the desired number of regions.

This consumption approach is ideal when only the module is used within the current project. This scenario can manifest in layered or multi-region architectures.

## Remote Repositories

Using external modules is the best way to capitalize on highly reusable patterns within your architecture. Terraform allows you to reference a module that is not stored in your project’s source code repository. The most common way of referencing a remote module is via a Git repository. This method works with any Git-compatible repository, from GitHub to Azure DevOps to Gitlab. 

Publishing your modules publicly on the open internet makes it extremely easy to reference them from any source code repository, whether public or private. However, in some enterprise scenarios, public repositories are not allowed—corporate governance may only allow private repositories. In these situations, you must select an authentication mechanism to access those modules as an end user and from within your pipelines. You can authenticate with your private, remote Terraform Module Repositories using an SSH Key or a Public Access Token.

Once you have secured your authentication to the Git repository that stores your modules, you must reference the module from your source code.

```
	module "foo" {
	  source = "git::ssh://git@ssh.dev.azure.com/v3/{AZDO_ORG}/{AZDO_PROJECT}/{AZDO_REPO}//{MODULE_PATH}"
	}
```

The above examples show how you reference a specific module hosted in a Git repository on Azure DevOps. Using this approach, you will access the default branch for the Git repository, which will most likely be `main`, and it will take the latest commit from that branch--never a good idea. 

The proper way is to specify a reference for a specific module version. When using the `ref` query string parameter for your Git repository URL, you can target a specific tag, branch, or commit within the Git repository.

```
	module "foo" {
	  source = "git::ssh://git@ssh.dev.azure.com/v3/{AZDO_ORG}/{AZDO_PROJECT}/{AZDO_REPO}//{MODULE_PATH}?ref={AZDO_TAG}"
	}
```

Tags are the ideal method to guarantee a specific version because creating a tag within a Git repository doesn't require changing your branching strategy. Once you are done testing the module, you can push a tag, and rest assured that you will always receive that exact version of the module when you specify that tag as the `ref` parameter.

## Terraform Registry

HashiCorp provides a mechanism for third-party module publishers to distribute their modules. This repository is accessible via registry.terraform.io and houses a tremendous wealth of Terraform modules in a publicly accessible, stable, and versioned environment. When you publish modules here, you must meet specific requirements to allow you and others to reference the module using a simple name and version.

```
	module "caf" {
	  source  = "aztfmod/caf/azurerm"
	  version = "~>5.5.0"
	}
```

The Terraform Module Registry ultimately uses GitHub under the hood, so you are referencing a module in a GitHub repository. However, it allows you to use a simplified module name and version without the additional complexity of the GitHub repository's information.
