# 4. Modularity

Everything lives in modules. When you make your first Terraform project, you inadvertently create your first Terraform Module. That’s because every Terraform project is a root module. In your root module, you declare providers, 

One ubiquitous pattern within Terraform is that when you code Resources, Modules, or Data Sources, you work with inputs and outputs. Each Terraform Resource and Data Source works in this manner, as does your entire Terraform workspace, allowing Terraform to be embedded neatly into a toolchain within a pipeline to provision an environment.

The root module doesn’t have to be the only module that you write. You can create reusable modules that are designed to encapsulate reusable aspects of your solutions that can be shared across root modules. The difference between a root module and a reusable module is that the root module is designed to be the entry point for deploying one or more environments. Reusable modules are simply components that define useful patterns or best practices that allow you to save time by having to re-create them whenever you want to create a new environment or a similar solution.
