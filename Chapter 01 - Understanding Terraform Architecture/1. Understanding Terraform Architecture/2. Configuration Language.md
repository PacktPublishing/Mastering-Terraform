# 2. Configuration Language

When Terraform was first only a glimmer in the minds of Armon Dadgar and Mitchell Hashimoto, the industry had two paradigms of "Infrastructure-as-Code": imperative, which dominated under the names of chef and puppet, using traditional programming languages like Ruby and Python. However, there were declarative approaches, but most were an exercise of crafting large and complex JSON documents. 

The two major cloud platforms, Amazon AWS and Microsoft Azure, had already adopted resource typing in their respective Infrastructure-as-Code solutions. AWS CloudFormation and Azure Resource Management (ARM) Templates leveraged a consistent schema to describe Resources of various types. Each Resource Type has a standard set of attributes that help the platform target the appropriate resource provider to handle the request. Likewise, each Resource Type had its own custom attributes and schema to configure its unique nature. But the solutions were silos within the respective cloud platforms. 

So, in many ways, the industry was primed and ready for a solution that would adopt a Resource Type-based approach and thus knock down the silos between cloud providers enabling, at the very least, a tool that could describe resources on multiple clouds within the same context. There were challenges with both imperative and declarative approaches. 

Imperative approaches resulted in overly complex code, nested structures, and elaborate state-checking logic made for difficult-to-maintain codebases that could quickly descend into spaghetti code. Also, programming language and platform heritage could stoke religious rivalries between developer camps.

The declarative solutions, on the other hand, relied on industry-standard document formats such as JSON and YAML. These formats encouraged a simple top-down approach and induced no tribalism due to their neutral nature. However, they made it difficult to represent complex expressions and implement simple iterations and loops, and even simple things like annotating code with code comments were not possible or overly cumbersome.

Terraform brought the best of both worlds by bringing elements of an imperative language, such as expressions and looping, and fusing it with the best of the declarative model that encouraged a simple top-down approach to defining resources within an environment.

HashiCorp Configuration Language uses simple block definitions that allow for a more concise representation of resources than other declarative solutions but a more code-like syntax, all linking between blocks that acknowledges the Resource Type-driven nature of cloud computing in its bones. 

```
	resource "random_string" "foo" {
	  length  = 4
	  upper   = false
	  special = false
	}
```

A block's definition has three parts: the Block Type, the Resource Type, and the Reference Name. In the above example, the Block Type is `resource`, the Resource Type is `random_string`, and the Reference Name is `foo`. To create dependencies between resources, we use the reference name and type to access output values from the resource.

	resource "azurerm_resource_group" "bar" {
	  name     = "rg-${random_string.foo.result}"
	  location = var.location
	}

In the above code, we create an Azure Resource Group by referencing the output value `result` from the Random String named `foo`.

This simple pattern describes how we can combine dozens, sometimes hundreds, of resources to build sophisticated cloud architectures. Using this pattern in HashiCorp Configuration Language allows Terraform to determine the relationships between our resources and construct a plan to provision them all. The funny part and the sheer brilliance of the whole thing is that it's just a fancy game of connecting the dots.
