# 5. Section Summary

Now that we have taken a high-level look at Terraform’s Architecture and understand the core technology, we know that it comprises the Terraform Command Line application and the functional language HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL). We also know that Terraform’s superpower is that the design of the core technology is highly extensible by leveraging Providers to adapt the technology to a multitude of extremely diverse platforms and technologies and the built-in modularity that enables practitioners to easily create simple or sophisticated Infrastructure-as-Code solutions that can be packaged and made to be reusable across teams and organizations.

Next, we’ll delve into a critical subsystem that enables Terraform to achieve consistent, idempotent Infrastructure-as-Code motion across various platforms and technologies.
