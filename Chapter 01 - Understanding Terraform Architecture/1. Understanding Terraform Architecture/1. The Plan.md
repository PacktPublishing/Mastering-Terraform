# 1. The Plan

The biggest differentiator of Terraform is that, well, Terraform plans ahead. When working with Terraform, you will be following a process where Terraform is used to analyze the existing environment. In doing this analysis, Terraform is determining what (if any) changes in the code need to be applied to the actual environment to bring it up to date. Terraform itemizes these changes as actions within the plan. While Terraform does this analysis on our behalf, produces the plan, and is fully capable of executing that plan against the environment, we are still responsible for reviewing the plan and determining if the planned changes are what we intended.

_Terraform Resources are straightforward machines with Inputs and Outputs_

Terraform represents every component in your environment as a resource in this analysis. Resources are extremely simple machines. They take inputs and produce outputs. They also can be chained together, thus creating explicit relationships between the components within your environment. These relationships inform Terraform's analysis of your environment and the sequence of actions enumerated in the plan.

Once we have decided that this plan is what we intended, we ask Terraform to execute it. Terraform will then apply that plan to our actual environment. The outcome of this process is that Terraform will bring our environment up to date with the description in the code.

Terraform's design encourages developers to repeat this process. Therefore, as the developer updates their code, with each iteration of the code applied to the environment, we will continually assess the current state and determine the future state to match the environment our code describes. Each time we run Terraform to assess the environment, it will produce a plan. This plan was generated at a point in time when evaluating the differences between the actual environment and the code base. 

On Day 1, since the environment does not exist, everything Terraform must create the developer described within the code. On Day 2, however, things are more complex. On Day 1, we started cleaning. However, on Day 2, we are still determining where we are starting because Terraform has already provisioned the environment once before. Many things could have changed since Day 1. We could have intentionally modified the code base to change the environment. Likewise, "gremlins" could have altered our environment during the night, thus introducing drift into our environment and requiring us to roll back their changes. 

To analyze the existing environment, Terraform consults two sources of information: Terraform State and the environment itself—via the Provider (which is also informed by Terraform State). If the Terraform State is empty, then Terraform assumes the environment does not exist and creates a plan that will create everything. 

![Resource][image-2]
_Plan - Day 1 - Everything needs to be created_

If Terraform State exists, things will get interesting, and Terraform will have to earn its paycheck. Terraform will use the Terraform State to analyze the environment by querying the Provider (s) about the health and configuration of each Resource declared within. Based on these results, Terraform will construct a set of instructions. Once Terraform executes these instructions, the current environment will match the desired environment—as described in the code. However, after the first time Terraform has executed your plan successfully if you ask Terraform to create a plan again, it will consult the Terraform State and use the Providers to consult the actual environment and see that no changes are needed.

![Resource][image-3]
_Plan - Day 2 - No changes in your environment_

To create such an instruction set, Terraform must generate a complete dependency graph of the resources within the environment to determine what order it must execute the instructions. The relationships between the resources infer these dependencies. If one Resource takes in, as an input variable, the value of another resource's output variable Terraform will determine that there is a dependency between these resources.

![Resource][image-4]
_Resource Dependencies - One Resource's Inputs is another Resource's outputs_

Sometimes, Terraform will only know the results of the instructions after executing them. Hence, the obligatory warning message “known after apply ."However, this dependency graph and the subsequent plan are the crux of the Terraform machine. 

This process makes Terraform an idempotent tool, meaning it can be applied multiple times without changing the result beyond the initial application.  Idempotence is not necessarily unique to Terraform across automation tools, as some tools operate similarly. Ansible is a great example, also ensuring that repeat operations do not alter the state unless necessary changes.

### Execution Phases

Terraform’s core workflow follows a three-stage process: Initialize, Plan, and Apply. Let’s examine each stage to see what parts of our codebase are being utilized and what actions Terraform is taking.

![Resource][image-5]

_Terraform Execution Phases_

#### Initialize
First, initialize the Terraform workspace using the `terraform init` command, which loads and configures all referenced providers and modules.

![Resource][image-6]

_Terraform Initialization loads provider and module dependencies and verifies backend connectivity_

#### Plan
Once a Terraform has initialized its workspace, it can generate a Plan using the `terraform plan` command. Although the command seems simple, this is a very complex process. 

First, a dependency graph is built of all resources using the implicit (and sometimes explicit relationships between them). Then, Terraform checks the State File to determine if it has already provisioned the Resource. Suppose the Resource exists in the State File. In that case, Terraform will communicate with the Resource via its respective Provider and compare the desired state with the expected state as stored in the State File and the actual state reported by the Provider. Terraform makes note of any differences and creates an action plan for each Resource. The action can be 'create,' 'update,' or 'destroy.' 

![Resource][image-7]

_Terraform Plan evaluates the current codebase with a set of input variables and compares it against the workspace's Terraform State_


#### Apply
Once a Terraform has generated a plan, it can optionally execute it against the actual environment using the `terraform apply` command. Using the dependency graph, Terraform will execute each resource action in sequence. If resource actions are not dependent on each other, then Terraform will execute them in parallel. During this phase, Terraform will constantly communicate with each provider, initiating commands and checking the status of the relevant provider. As Terraform completes resource actions, it will continually update the Terraform State.

![Resource][image-8]

_Terraform Apply executes the plan through communication with the providers, updates the Terraform State, and returns output variables_


### Resource Actions

When Terraform generates a plan, it evaluates each resource to determine if change is required to achieve the desired state of the infrastructure. There are several different situations where Terraform will determine action is needed on a particular resource.

##### Create
Create can occur in three situations: 
1. The Resource is Completely New
2. Something outside of Terraform deleted the Resource
3. The developer updated a Resource's code in such a way that the Provider requires it to be Destroyed and Re-Created

![Resource][image-9]

_Adding a new resource_

When a resource is entirely new, it doesn't exist in the Terraform State File. For example, we want to create a Virtual Machine named “vm001”. If this is the case, Terraform doesn't use the Provider to check if the Resource is there. As a result, you can run into situations where the plan will generate successfully, but when Terraform executes the plan, it will fail. This situation usually boils down to Resource naming conflicts when another user has provisioned another unrelated resource with the same name as the one Terraform plans to create (i.e., somebody has already provisioned a Virtual Machine named “vm001”). This situation can occur if someone creates the Resource manually or even when the Resource is created through Terraform but in a different Terraform Workspace and, consequently, a different Terraform State File.

A prime example of the concept of 'Drift' is when someone deletes a resource outside of Terraform.

![Resource][image-10]

_Drift: Manually removing or modifying a resource outside of Terraform_

When a developer changes a resource, sometimes the Provider requires it to be Destroyed and then Re-Created. For example, if we want to change our Virtual Machine’s hardware profile from 4 CPU Cores and 16 GB RAM to 8 CPU Cores and 32 GB RAM. This logic exists in the provider’s codebase at the resource level. It would help if you carefully check the documentation of the resources you are using to ensure you are aware of any potential disruptions or data loss that could occur when updates force a resource to be destroyed and recreated.

##### Change
Change can occur in two situations:
1. The Resource has changed in code
2. The Resource has been modified outside of Terraform

![Resource][image-11]

_Update an existing resource_

This change won’t require the resource to be destroyed and re-created. This could be something simple like changing the tags of a resource. These types of changes can also be introduced by drift. For example, someone adds a new tag manually using the cloud platform’s management portal without updating the Terraform codebase.

##### Destroy
Destroy can occur in two situations:
1. The developer deleted the resource from the code
2. The developer updated a resource's code in such a way that the provider requires it to be destroyed and re-created

This could be as simple as removing an unused—or, more likely, no longer used—resource. For example, removing an unnecessary Network Security Group rule—like one that grants access to Port 22 to the entire Internet—is probably a good idea!

Resource action plans can have a cascading effect. Naturally, dependent resources are also new if a resource is entirely new. However, it would be best to be mindful when the Resource needs to be destroyed and re-created. This action is called a "Drop-Create". When a Resource plays a very critical role within the environment, it is very common that when a Drop-Create occurs, there will be a large swath of the resource graph that will also be destroyed and then re-created—usually, any resource dependent on the Resource being Drop-Created.
